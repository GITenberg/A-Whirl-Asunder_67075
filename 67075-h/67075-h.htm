<p><span class="smcap">As</span> the train stopped for the sixth
time, Clive descended abruptly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think I&#8217;ll walk the rest of the
way,&#8221; he said to the conductor.
&#8220;Just look after my portmanteau,
will you? and see that it is left at
Yorba with my boxes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;O. K.&#8221;, said the man. &#8220;But
you must like walking.&#8221;</p>

<p>Clive had spent seven days on the
ocean, three in the furious energy
of New York, and six on a transcontinental
train, whose discomforts
made him wonder if he had a moral<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>
right to enter the embarrassing
state of matrimony with a temper
hopelessly soured. As he had come
to California to marry, and as his
betrothed was at a hotel in the
northern redwoods, he did not
pause for rest in San Francisco;
he left, two hours after his arrival,
on a narrow guage train, which
dashed down precipitous mountain
slopes, shot, rocking from side to
side, about curves on a road so narrow
that the brush scraped the windows,
or the eye looked down into
the blackness of a ca&ntilde;on, five hundred
feet below; raced shrieking
across trestles which seemed to swing
midway between heaven and earth;
only to slacken, with protesting
snort and jerk, when climbing to
some dizzier height. Clive had
stood for an hour on the platform,
fascinated by the danger and the
bleak solemnity of the forests,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span>
whose rigid trunks and short stiffly
pointed arms looked as if they had
not quivered since time began. But
he felt that he had had enough,
moreover that he had not drawn an
uncompanioned breath since he
left England. If he was not possessed
by the graceful impatience of
the lover, he reminded himself that
he was tired and nervous, and had
been obliged to go dirty for six days,
enough to knock the romance out
of any man; the ubiquitous human
animal had talked incessantly for
sixteen days, and his legs ached for
want of stretching.</p>

<p>A twisted old man with a sharp
eye, a rusty beard depending aimlessly
from a thin tobacco-stained
mouth, limped across the platform,
rolling a flag. Clive asked him if
he could get to the Yorba hotel on
foot.</p>

<p>The man stared. &#8220;Well, you <i>be</i><span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
an Englishman, <i>I</i> guess,&#8221; he remarked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I am an Englishman,&#8221; said
Clive haughtily.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no offence, but the way you
English do walk beats us. We ain&#8217;t
none too fond of walkin&#8217; in Californy.
Too many mountains, I guess. Yes,
you kin walk it, and I guess you&#8217;ll
have to. There goes your train.
Stranger in these parts?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I arrived in California to-day.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So. Goin&#8217; to raise cattle, or
just seein&#8217; the wonders of the Gold
State?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you kindly point out
the way? And I should like to
send a dispatch to the hotel, if possible.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, suttenly. We don&#8217;t think
much of English manners in these
parts, I don&#8217;t mind sayin&#8217;. You
English act as if you owned God
Almighty when you come out here.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>
You forget we licked ye twice.
Come after a Californy heiress?&#8221;</p>

<p>Clive felt an impulse to throw the
man over the trestle, then laughed.
&#8220;I beg your pardon,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I
am sorry my manners are bad but
the truth is my head is tired and my
legs are not. Come, show me the
way.&#8221;</p>

<p>Being further mollified by a silver
dollar, the old man replied graciously,
&#8220;All right, sir. Just amuse
yourself while I send your telegram,
and fetch a dark lantern. You&#8217;ll
need it. The moon&#8217;s doin&#8217; well, but
the tops of them redwoods knit together,
and are as close as a roof.&#8221;</p>

<p>Clive walked idly about the little
waiting-room. The walls were decorated
with illustrated weekly newspapers,
and the gratuitous lithograph.
John L. Sullivan, looking,
under the softening influence of the
weekly artist, as if sculptured from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
mush, glowered across at Corbett,
who displayed his muscles in a dandified
attitude. There were also
several lithographs of pretty, rather
elegant-looking girls. Clive noticed
that one had a rude frame of
young redwood branches about it,
and occupied the post of honor at
the head of the room. He walked
over and examined it as well as he
could by the light of the smoking
lamp.</p>

<p>The head was in profile, severe in
outline, as classic as the modern
head ever is. The chin was lifted
proudly, the nostrils looked capable
of expansion. The brow and eyes
suggested intellect, the lower part
of the face pride and self-will and
passion, perhaps undeveloped cruelty
and sensuality.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who is Miss Belmont?&#8221; he
asked, as the station agent left the
telegraph table.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>&#8220;Oh, she&#8217;s one of the heiresses.
That&#8217;s our high-toned society paper.
It&#8217;s printin&#8217; a series of Californy
heiresses. One of the other papers
says as how it&#8217;s a good guide book
for impecoonious furriners, and I
guess that&#8217;s about the size of it.
She&#8217;s got a million, and nobody but
an aunt, and she has her own way, I&mdash;tell&mdash;you.
She&#8217;ll be a handful to
manage; but somehow, although
she keeps people talkin&#8217;, they don&#8217;t
believe as much harm of her as of
some that&#8217;s more quiet. You&#8217;ll
meet her, I guess, if you&#8217;re goin&#8217; to
stay at Yorba, for she&#8217;s got a big
house in the redwoods and knows a
lot of the hotel folks and the Bohemian
Club fellers. I like her. She
rides this way once a year or so,
and we have a good chin about
politics. She knows a thing or
two, you bet, and she believes in
Grover.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>&#8220;How old is she? And why
doesn&#8217;t she marry?&#8221; asked Clive
idly, as they walked up the road.</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s twenty-six, and she&#8217;s goin&#8217;
to marry&mdash;a Noo York feller; one
of them with Dutch names. She&#8217;s
had offers, <i>I</i> guess. Three of your
lords, I know of. But lords don&#8217;t
stand much show with Californy
girls&mdash;them as was raised here, anyhow.
They don&#8217;t give a damn for
titles, and they scent a fortune-hunter
before he&#8217;s off the dock.
They&#8217;ve put their heads together
and talked him over before he&#8217;s
registered. This Dutchman&#8217;s got
money, so I guess he&#8217;s all right. Be
you a lord?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not. I am a barrister, and
the son of a barrister.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What may that be?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I believe you call it lawyer out
here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;O&mdash;h&mdash;h&mdash;a lawyer&#8217;s a gay bird,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
ain&#8217;t he? And don&#8217;t he have a good
time?&#8221; The old man chuckled.</p>

<p>&#8220;I never found them different
from other men. What do you
mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ours are rippers. I&#8217;ve been in
Californy since &#8217;49, and I could spin
some yarns that would make your
hair curl, young man. Lord, Lord,
the old ones were tough. The
young ones ain&#8217;t quite so bad, but
they&#8217;re doing their best.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;California is rather a wild place,
isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was. It&#8217;s quietin&#8217; down now,
and it ain&#8217;t near so interestin&#8217;. Jack
Belmont, that there young lady&#8217;s
father, was a lawyer when he fust
come here, but he struck it rich in
Con. Virginia, in &#8217;74, and after that
warn&#8217;t he a ripper. Oh, Lord! He
<i>was</i> a terror. But he done his dooty
by his girl; had her eddicated in
Paris and Noo York, and never let no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
one cross her. He was as fine-lookin&#8217;
a man as ever I seen, almost as tall
and clean made as you be, and awful
open-handed and popular, although
a terrible enemy. He&#8217;s shot his man
twice over, they say, and I believe
it. His wife died ten years before
him. She was fond of him, too,
poor thing, and he made no bones
about bein&#8217; unfaithful to her&mdash;they
don&#8217;t out here. A man&#8217;s no good if
you can&#8217;t tell a yarn or two about
him. Well, Jack Belmont died five
years ago, and left about a million
dollars to his girl. He&#8217;d had a long
sight more, but she was lucky to git
that. They say as how she was
awful broke up when he died.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a regular old <i>chronique
scandaleuse</i>,&#8221; said Clive, much interested.
&#8220;What sort of a social position
has this Miss Belmont? Is she
received?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Received? Glory, man&mdash;why<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
her father was a Southern gent&mdash;Maryland,
as I remember, and her
mother was from Boston. They led
society here in the sixties; they&#8217;re
one of the old families of Californy.
That&#8217;s the reason Miss Belmont
does as she damned pleases, and
nobody dares say boo&mdash;that and the
million. She&#8217;s ancient aristocracy,
she is. Received! Oh, Lord!&#8221;</p>

<p>Clive, much amused, asked,
&#8220;What does she do that is so dreadful?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, she&#8217;s been engaged fifteen
times; she rides about the country
in boy&#8217;s clothes, and sits up all
night under the trees at Del
Monte talkin&#8217; to a man, or gives all
her dances to one man at a party,
and then cuts him the next day on
the street; and when she gits tired
of people, comes up here without
even her aunt. She used to run to
fires, but she give that up some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
years ago. She travels about the
country for weeks without a chaperon,
and once went camping alone
with five men. Sometimes she&#8217;ll fill
her house up with men for a week,
and not have no other woman, savin&#8217;
her aunt. Lately she&#8217;s more quiet,
they say, and has become a terrible
reader. Last winter she stayed up
here for three months alone. I
hear as how people talked. But I
didn&#8217;t see nothin&#8217;. She&#8217;s all right,
or my name ain&#8217;t Jo Bagley. Well,
here you are, sir. Good luck to ye!
Keep to the road and don&#8217;t strike off
on any of them side trails, and you
can&#8217;t go wrong. Evenin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>

<p>Clive went into the dark forest.
What the old man had told him of
Miss Belmont had quickened his
imagination, and he speculated
about her for some moments; then
his thoughts wandered to his English
betrothed. He had not seen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
her for two years. Her mother&#8217;s
health failing, her father had taken
his family to Southern California.
A year later Mrs. Gordon had died,
and her husband having bought a
ranch in which he was much interested,
had written to Clive that he
wanted his eldest daughter for
another year; by that time her sister
would have finished school, and
could take her place as head of the
household. Lately he and Mary had
felt the debilitating influence of the
southern climate and had gone to
the redwoods of the north. There
Clive was to meet them, remain a few
weeks, then marry in San Francisco
and take his wife back to England.</p>

<p>Clive was thirty-four, ten years
older than Mary Gordon. He recalled
the day he had proposed to
her. She had come down the steps
of her father&#8217;s house, in a blue gown
and garden hat, and they had gone<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
for a walk in the woods. She was
not a clever woman, and she had
only the white and pink and brown,
the rounded lines of youth, no positive
beauty of face or figure; but
with the blind instinct of his race he
had turned almost automatically to
the type of woman who, time out of
mind, has produced the strong-limbed,
strong-brained men that
have made a nation insolently great.
She reminded him of his mother,
with her even sweetness of nature,
her sympathy, her large maternal
suggestion. He had known her
since her early girlhood and grown
fonder of her each year. She rested
him, and had the divine feminine
faculty of making him feel a better
and cleverer man than he was in
the habit of thinking himself else
where.</p>

<p>She had accepted him with the
sweetest smile he had ever seen,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
and he had wondered if other men
were as fortunate. For two years
he saw much of her, then she went
to America, and he had plunged
into his work and his man&#8217;s life, not
missing her as consistently as he
had expected, but caring for her
none the less. The Saturday mail
brought him, unintermittingly, a
letter eight pages long, neatly written,
and describing in detail the
daily life of her family, and of the
strange people about them. They
were calm, affectionate, interesting
letters, which Clive enjoyed, and to
which he replied with a hurried
scrawl, rarely covering more than
one page. An Englishwoman does
not expect much, but Mary occasionally
hinted sadly that a longer
letter would make her happier;
whereupon his conscience hurt him
and he wrote her two pages.</p>

<p>He enjoyed these two years, despite<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
hard work; he was popular
with men and women, and much
was popular with him that adds to
the keener pleasures of life. When
the time came to pack his boxes and
go to America he puffed a large
regretful rack from his last pipe of
freedom; but it did not occur to
him to ask release. For the matter
of that, although he had come
to regard Mary Gordon as the inevitable
rather than the desired,
he had felt for her the strong tenderness
which such men feel for
such women, which endures, and
never in any circumstance turns to
hate.</p>

<p>After a time Clive extinguished
the lantern: it illumined the road
fitfully, but accentuated the dense
blackness of the forest. The undergrowth
was too thick to permit him
to stray aside, and he wanted to
form some idea of his surroundings.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
His eyes accustomed themselves to
the dark. Moon rays splashed or
trickled here and there through
lofty cleft and mesh. Clive paused
once and looked up. The straight
trees, sometimes slender, sometimes
huge, were as inflexible as granite,
an unbroken column for a hundred
feet or more; then thrusting out
rigid arms from a tapering trunk
into another hundred feet of space.
The effect was that of a dense forest
suspended in air, supported above
the low brush forest on a vast irregular
colonnade, out of whose ruins
it might have sprung. Clive had
never known a stillness so profound,
a repose so absolute. But it was
not the peaceful repose of an English
wood. It suggested the heavy
brooding stillness of archaic days,
when the uneasy world drowsed
before another convulsion. There
was some other influence abroad in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
the woods, but at the time its meaning
eluded him.</p>

<p>Suddenly it occurred to him that
he could not see Mary Gordon in
this forest. There was an irritating
incongruity in the very thought.
She belonged to the sweet calm
beech woods, of England; nothing
in her was in consonance with the
storm and stress, the passion and
fatality which this strange country
suggested. Did the women of California
fit their frame? He experienced
a strong desire for the companionship
of a woman who would
interpret this forest to him, then
called himself an ass and strode on.</p>

<p>An hour later he became aware
of a distant and deep murmur. It
was crossed suddenly by a wild,
hilarious yell. Clive relit the lantern
and flashed it along the brush
at his right. Presently he came
upon a narrow trail. The prospect<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
of adventure after sixteen days of
civilized monotony lured him aside,
and he walked rapidly down the by-path.
In a few moments he found
himself on the edge of a large clearing.
The moon poured in without
let, and revealed a scene of singular
and uncomfortable suggestion.</p>

<p>In the middle of the space was a
huge funeral pyre; beyond it, evidently
on a bier, Clive could see the
stony, upturned feet of a mammoth
corpse, lightly covered with a white
pall. Between the pyre and the
trees nearer him a large caldron
swung over a heap of fagots, which
were beginning to crackle gently.
The place looked as if about to be
the scene of some awful rite. Englishmen
are willing to believe anything
about California, and Clive,
who had commanded the admiration
of his father&#8217;s colleagues with his
clear, quick, logical brain, leaped at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
once to the conclusion that this part
of California was still the hunting-ground
of the Red Indian, and that
some mighty chief was about to be
cremated; whilst his widow, perchance,
sacrificed herself in the caldron.</p>

<p>He plunged his hands into his
pockets and awaited developments
with the nervous delight of a
schoolboy. Although the forest
was silent again, he had an uneasy
sense of many human beings at no
great distance.</p>

<p>He had not long to wait. There
was a sudden red glare which made
the aisles of the forest seem alive
with dancing shapes, hideously contorted.
Simultaneously there arose
a low soft chanting, monotonous
and musical, bizarre rather than
weird. Then out of the recesses on
the far side of the clearing, startlingly
defined under the blaze of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
many torches held aloft in the background,
emerged a high priest, his
crown shaven, his beard flowing
to his waist, his white robes marking
the austerity of his order. His
hands were folded on his breast, his
head bowed. Behind him, two and
two, followed twenty acolytes,
swinging censers, the heavy perfume
of the incense rising to the pungent
odor of the redwoods, blending
harmoniously: the lofty forest
aisles were become those of some
vast primeval crypt.</p>

<p>Then illusion was in a measure
dispelled. The two hundred torch-bearers
who came after wore the
ordinary outing clothes of civilization.</p>

<p>The strange procession marched
slowly round the circle, passing
perilously close to Clive. Then the
priest and acolytes walked solemnly
up to the caldron, the others dispersing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
themselves irregularly, leaping
occasionally and waving their
torches. The fagots were blazing;
Clive fancied he heard a merry bubbling.
A moment of profound silence.
Then the priest dropped
something into the caldron, chanting
an invocation of which Clive
could make nothing, although he
was a scholar in several languages.
The acolytes and torch-bearers
tossed to the priest entities and imaginations,
which he dropped with
much ceremony into the caldron,
to the accompaniment of hollow,
not to say ribald laughter, and jests
which had a strong flavor of personalities.</p>

<p>The prologue lasted ten minutes.
Then the mummers crowded backward
and faced the pyre. Again
the heavy silence fell. The priest
went forward, and raising his clasped
hands and set face to the moon,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
stood, for a moment, like a statue
on a monument, then turned slowly
and beckoned. The acolytes formed
in line and marched with solemn
precision to the other side of the
pyre. A moment later they reappeared,
walking with halting steps,
their heads bowed, chanting dismally.
On their shoulders they
carried a long bier, on which, apparently,
lay the corpse of a dead
giant. The priest sprinkled the
body, then turned away with a gesture
of loathing. The acolytes
carried it by the torch-bearers, who
spat upon and execrated it; then
slowly and laboriously mounted the
pyre, and dropping the bier on its
apex, scampered indecorously down
with savage grunts of satisfaction,
their white garments fluttering
along the dark pile like a wash on a
windy day. The corpse lay long
and white and horrid under the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
beating moon and the flare of torch.
As the acolytes reached the ground
the rest of the company rushed
simultaneously forward, and with a
hideous yell flung their torches at
the pyre. There was the hiss of
tar, the leap of one great flame, an
angry crackling. A moment more
and the forest would be more vividly
alight than it had ever been at
noonday. Clive, feeling as uncomfortable
as an eavesdropper, but
too fascinated to retreat, stepped
behind a large redwood. With his
eyes still fixed on the strange scene
he did not pick his steps, and coming
suddenly in contact with a pliable
body, he nearly knocked it over.
There was a smothered shriek, followed
by a suppressed but forcible
vocative. Clive mechanically lifted
his hat.</p>

<p>&#8220;I beg your pardon,&#8221; he said, addressing
a tall lad, whose face was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
partly concealed by the visor of a
cap; &#8220;I hope I have not hurt
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not so easily hurt,&#8221; said
the lad haughtily.</p>

<p>The masculine man never lived
who did not recognize a feminine
woman in whatever guise, if within
the radius of her magnetism. This
young masquerader interested
Clive at once. Her voice had a
warm huskiness. The mouth and
chin were classically cut, but very
human. She had thrown back her
head and revealed a round beautiful
throat. The loose flannel shirt
and jacket concealed her figure, but
even the slight motions she had
made revealed energy and grace.</p>

<p>Clive offered her a cigarette.
She accepted it and smoked daintily,
withdrawing as much as possible
into the shadow and shielding her
face with her hand. He leaned his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
back against the tree and lit a
cigar.</p>

<p>&#8220;What on earth is the meaning of
this scene?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;That is the great Midsummer
Jinks ceremony of the Bohemian
Club. They have it every year, and
never invite outsiders. So I was
bound I&#8217;d see it anyhow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wonder you don&#8217;t become a
member.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m too young,&#8221; promptly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell me more about it. What
do these ceremonies mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, they put all sorts of things
into that caldron&mdash;the liver of a
grasshopper with one of Harry
Armstrong&#8217;s jokes; the wasted
paint on somebody&#8217;s last picture with
the misshapen feet of somebody&#8217;s
else latest verse. The corpse is an
effigy of Care, and they are cremating
him. Now they&#8217;ll be happy,
that is to say, drunk, till morning,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
for Care is dead. I&#8217;m going to stop
and see it out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think you had better go
home.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Indeed?&#8221; Clive saw the hand
that shielded her face jerk.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you ever see, or rather hear
a lot of men on a lark when
they fancied that no women were
about?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No; but that is what I wish to
do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Which you are not going to do
to-night.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a sudden snapping of
dry leaves. A small foot had come
down with emphasis.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>What</i> do you mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That this is no place for a
woman, and that you must go.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not&mdash;well, I am, and I don&#8217;t
care in the least whether you know
it or not. I wish you to understand,
sir, that I shall stay here, and that I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
am not in the habit of being dictated
to.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are Miss Belmont, I suppose.&#8221;</p>

<p>An instant&#8217;s pause. Then she
replied with a haughty pluck which
delighted him: &#8220;Yes, I am Miss
Belmont, and you are an insolent
Englishman.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How do you know that I am an
Englishman?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Anyone could tell from your
voice and your overbearing manner.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I am,&#8221; said Clive, much
amused.</p>

<p>&#8220;I detest Englishmen.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Smoke a little, or I am afraid
you will cry.&#8221;</p>

<p>She obeyed with unexpected docility,
but in a moment crushed the
coal of her cigarette on a damp
tree stump. Then she turned to
him and folded her arms.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>&#8220;I am not going to leave,&#8221; she
said evenly. &#8220;What are you going
to do about it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How did you get here?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;On my horse.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where is he?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tethered off the road.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well; if you are not on
that horse in five minutes, I shall
carry you to it, and what is more, I
shall kiss you.&#8221;</p>

<p>She deliberately moved into the
light and pushed her cap to the
back of her head, disarranging a
mass of curling dark hair. Her
coloring was indefinable in the red
light, but her eyes were large and
long, and heavily lashed. They
sparkled wickedly. The nostrils of
her finely cut nose were dilating;
her short upper lip was lifted.
Clive ardently hoped that she would
continue to defy him. Her whole
attitude was that of a young worldling,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
delighting in an unforeseen adventure.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who are you, anyhow?&#8221; she demanded.
&#8220;Of course I could see
at once that you were a gentleman,
or I should not have taken the
slightest notice of you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thanks. My name is Owin
Clive.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, you are Mary Gordon&#8217;s
friend, that she has been expecting.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Miss Gordon is an old friend of
mine.&#8221; He half-consciously hoped
that Miss Belmont did not know of
his engagement.</p>

<p>&#8220;She says you are frightfully
handsome.&#8221;</p>

<p>Clive laughed. &#8220;I cannot imagine
Miss Gordon using any such expression;
but then she has been
two years in California.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose Englishmen can&#8217;t
help being rude. I remember exactly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
what she said, and she said it
so slowly and placidly. &#8216;Oh, yes,
dear Miss Belmont, I think our men
are very fine-looking indeed.&#8217; (I
had been black-guarding them.)
&#8216;My friend, Mr. Clive, of whom you
have heard me speak, is quite the
handsomest man I have ever seen.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That sounds more like it. And
that is exactly what she would have
said two years ago. I mean,&#8221;
laughing with some embarrassment,
&#8220;the way she would have expressed
herself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I suppose you are a mass of
vanity; all men are. Yes; your
Mary Gordon is as English as if she
had never left Hertfordshire. And
always will be. She hasn&#8217;t a spark
of originality.&#8221;</p>

<p>Clive discerned her purpose, but
he replied coldly, &#8220;Say rather that
she has individuality.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Which she hasn&#8217;t, and you know<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
it. I have that. Do you think
there is much in common between
us?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How can I tell after knowing
you ten minutes?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t get a rise out of you, I
see. You Englishmen are such
phlegmatic creatures. I don&#8217;t believe
there is a spark of impulse
left in your island.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are a very brave young
woman.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221; She drew her eyelashes
together, shooting forth audacity.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you want me to kiss you?&#8221;</p>

<p>The muscles of her face twitched
angrily. &#8220;An Englishman&#8217;s only
idea of wit is impertinence.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What have Englishmen done to
you that you are so bitter? I
don&#8217;t believe those lordlings I have
heard of, proposed, after all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They did,&#8221; replied Miss Belmont<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
emphatically, and quite restored.
&#8220;Every last one of them.
I made Dynebor fetch and carry
like a trained dog. It was great
fun. I used to say, before a room
full of people, &#8216;Go get my fan, little
man; I left it with Charley Rollins
in the conservatory.&#8217; And he
would trot off; he was that hard
up, poor thing!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am glad you did not marry
any of them; I am sure they were
not good enough for you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How polite of you. Why don&#8217;t
you step out and let me see you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My vanity will not permit. I
feel sure that your remarkable
frankness would not allow you to
disguise your disappointment.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I shall see you on Sunday.
You are coming with Miss Gordon
to dine with me. She has accepted
for you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall wait until then. I look<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
better in evening clothes and when
I am clean.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I like your voice and your figure,
and you certainly have a remarkable
amount of magnetism,&#8221;
she said meditatively. &#8220;Good heavens!
what a row those idiots are
making. And do look at that bonfire.
It looks for all the world as
if the earth had run its tongue out
at the moon.&#8221;</p>

<p>Clive wondered why he did not
kiss her. He certainly wanted to,
and he certainly would have been
justified. He recalled no other attractive
woman who would have had
to offer half the encouragement
with which Miss Belmont had
recklessly toyed. A man who
coined epigrams for sale had once
said of him: &#8220;Clive is thoroughbred;
he can drink the strongest
whiskey, smoke the blackest cigars,
and he never fails to kiss a pretty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
woman when the opportunity offers.&#8221;
And yet, so far, something about
Miss Belmont stayed him. He had
no intention that it should endure,
however.</p>

<p>The scene was growing more and
more picturesque. Behind them
was a great roar, crossed by the
howling and yelling of two hundred
and twenty-one abandoned throats.
The remotest aisles of the forest
were crimson. Every needle of the
delicate young redwoods, every
waving frond was etched minutely
on the red transparency. The thousand
columns with their stark capitals
wore a softened and gracious
aspect, albeit the general effect of
the night was infernal.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you going?&#8221; asked Clive.</p>

<p>&#8220;No.&#8221; She curled her lips defiantly
away from her teeth.</p>

<p>Clive crossed the short space between
them with one step, lifted her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
in his arms and walked rapidly up
the trail. For a moment she was
too stupefied to protest; then she attempted
violently to free herself.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221; she cried
furiously. &#8220;Do you know who I
am? I am in the habit of doing exactly
as I please. Everybody knows
me here. If you have misunderstood
me it&#8217;s because you are a
thick-headed Englishman, used to
women who are either stupid or bad.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You mean that the men you surround
yourself with are idiots who
permit you to play with them as you
choose. Keep quiet. Don&#8217;t you
see that you can&#8217;t get away? If
you struggle I shall hurt you, and I
don&#8217;t want to do that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have sat up all night with men
and they have never dared to kiss
me, however much they may have
wanted to.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then they were rotters, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
you can tell them so, with my compliments.
If I sat up all night with
you I should kiss you, and several
times.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you never will!&#8221;</p>

<p>They reached the road. She stiffened
suddenly and tried to spring
out of his arms. He placed her on
her feet and grasped her firmly by
the shoulders.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; he said, &#8220;kiss me, and
don&#8217;t be silly about it. If you go in
for larks of this sort you must take
the consequences.&#8221; She wrenched
again. He caught and held her so
firmly that she could not struggle.</p>

<p>&#8220;You brute of an Englishman,&#8221;
she gasped.</p>

<p>Clive clasped his hand about the
lower part of her face and lifted it
gently. As he did so he shifted his
position and the light, for the first
time, shone full on his face. The
girl became suddenly quiet. Something<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
leaped into her eyes which
his own answered. But as he
bent his face she moved her head
backward along his shoulder.</p>

<p>&#8220;Please, <i>please</i> don&#8217;t,&#8221; she said
beseechingly. &#8220;Oh, please don&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>Clive let her go. He walked with
her to the horse, mounted her, and
watched her dash away.</p>

<p>&#8220;What a stupid ass I am,&#8221; he
thought. &#8220;Why on earth didn&#8217;t I
kiss that woman?&#8221;</p>

<p>He walked up the road for a few
moments, then turned and made for
the clearing.</p>

<p>The flames were still leaping symmetrically
upward into a dense column
of smoke, the men still dancing
about the pyre, their enthusiasm unabated.
As Clive suddenly appeared
in their midst an immediate and
disagreeable silence fell. Clive had
never felt so uncomfortable in his
life. He concealed a certain amount<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
of natural shyness under a haughty
bearing, which would have repelled
strangers had it not been for his
charm of expression, the quick
laughter of his eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Does Mr. Charles Rollins happen
to be here?&#8221; he asked stiffly.
&#8220;I have brought a letter to him.
My name is Clive. I have an apology
to make. I stumbled upon
your strange ceremony and watched
it, not knowing at the time that
there was anything private about
it&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t mention it. Don&#8217;t mention
it,&#8221; cried a hearty voice. A
young man pushed forward from
the back of the circle and grasped
his hand. &#8220;I had a letter from
Stanley and hoped you would get
here in time for this. You can make
up for being late only by drinking
six quarts of fizz between now and
sunrise. Boys, come up and shake.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>Clive&#8217;s hand was shaken, with a
solemnity which at first embarrassed,
then amused him, by every
man present. Then solemnity vanished,
and with it any lingering remnant
of Clive&#8217;s shyness.</p>

<p>The odor of savory viands mingled
with burning pitch and the subtler
perfumes of the forest. A great
table was spread. Champagne corks
flew. Before an hour was done Clive
was voted the liveliest Englishman,
that had ever set foot in California,
and elected off-hand an honorary
member of the Bohemian Club.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER II.</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">At</span> four o&#8217;clock Clive once more
started for Yorba. He had not
drunken six quarts of champagne,
but he had commanded the respect
of his comrades by the courage
with which he had mixed his drinks.
Rollins had held his head under a
waterfall, in the little river, but
it still felt very large. He took
off his straw hat and looked at it
resentfully. Why had he not worn
his traveling cap? He also felt
depressed, and reproached himself
vehemently. What must Mary
Gordon think? Doubtless she was
sitting up, waiting for him, and
thought him dead&mdash;murdered.
Nevertheless he had enjoyed himself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
thoroughly, and he found remorse
more coy than he would have
wished. He had an uneasy consciousness
that if his head did not
ache so confoundedly he would not
feel remorse at all.</p>

<p>His thoughts wandered to Miss
Belmont. &#8220;I believe I found the
woman for the forest, after all. I
wonder if she would fit it as well
now. Perhaps, in another mood. I
fancy she is a woman of many.&#8221;</p>

<p>The redwoods were dripping with
mist, itself as motionless as the
silent trees it shrouded. It filled
every hollow, was banked in every
aisle, lay like silver cobweb on the
young redwoods and ferns. It emphasized
the ghastly silence. Not
a bird was awake, not a crawling
thing moved. Once a panther cried
far up on the mountain, but that was
all.</p>

<p>Clive came upon the hotel an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
hour later, a long rough wooden
structure at the foot of the mountain,
up which straggled many cottages.
Hard by, across a little creek, were a
saloon and billiard room. As he
ascended the steps, a stout man with
a red heavy face, came out of the
office, stretching himself.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re Mr. Clive, the Gordons&#8217;
friend, I surmise,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope they haven&#8217;t sat up for
me.&#8221; He devoutly hoped they had
not.</p>

<p>&#8220;They hain&#8217;t. Miss Gordon
waited till twelve, then concluded
you&#8217;d fallen in with the Bohemian
Club, as she knowed you&#8217;d brought
a letter to Rollins. Jedging by the
looks of you I should say you had.
Come over to the bar and taper off.
My name&#8217;s Hart and I run this hotel.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; said Clive grimly,
&#8220;but I&#8217;ll have no more to-night. Be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
good enough to show me to my room,
and be sure to have me wakened at
eight. I suppose Mr. and Miss Gordon
are not up before then. If they
are, please give them my compliments
and tell them that I did fall
in with the Bohemian Club.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> Clive awoke and looked at
his watch it was a quarter to three
in the afternoon. He sprang out of
bed in dismay. He was an ideal
lover! If Mary Gordon sent him
about his business he could not question
the justice of the act. After a
hurried tub and toilet he went in
search of his landlord.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why in thunder didn&#8217;t you call
me at eight?&#8221; he asked savagely.</p>

<p>&#8220;Miss Gordon was up at seven,
mister, and she gave strict orders
that you was not to be disturbed.
I&#8217;m to take you over to her cottage
the minute you show up and to send
a broiled chicken after you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s an angel,&#8221; thought Clive,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
&#8220;and will certainly make an ideal
wife.&#8221;</p>

<p>He followed his host out of the
hotel and up the hill. The summer
girl in pink and blue, sailor hat and
shirt-waist, dotted the greenery; in
rare instances attended by a swain.
On the piazzas of the hotel and cottages
older women knitted or read
novels.</p>

<p>The day was very warm. The
sun shone down into the forest
above and about the cottages, where
the trees were not so densely planted
as in the depths. The under-forest
looked very green and fresh. A
creek murmured somewhere. Bees
hummed drowsily.</p>

<p>Clive&#8217;s head still ached and he was
hungry; but at this moment he was
conscious of nothing but a paramount
wish to see Mary Gordon.</p>

<p>Mr. Gordon, a pink-faced man
with white side-whiskers, was standing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
on the piazza of a tiny cottage
which looked as if it had been built
in a night. He winked at Clive as he
came down and shook him heartily
by the hand. He had loved his wife
and been kind to her, but had always
done exactly as he pleased.</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s inside,&#8221; he whispered,
&#8220;and I don&#8217;t think she&#8217;ll row you.
Sorry it happened, just vow it never
will again and she&#8217;ll forget it. They
always do, bless them!&#8221;</p>

<p>Clive went hastily into the little
parlor. Mary Gordon was standing
in the middle of the room, her hands
tightly clasped, her eyes very bright,
her upper lip caught between her
teeth. Clive saw in a glance that
she had more style and grace of
carriage than when she had left
England. Her hair was more fashionably
arranged, and altogether she
was a handsomer girl. He took her
in his arms and kissed her many<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
times, and she cried softly on his
shoulder. He humbled himself to
the dust and was told that he must
always do exactly what he wanted;
and he felt a distinct thrill of pleasureable
domestic anticipation. He
had been spoiled all his life, and
would have taken to matrimonial
discipline very unkindly.</p>

<p>When he had eaten of the broiled
chicken and several other substantial
delicacies, and was at peace
with himself and the world once
more, he went for a long walk in the
forest with Mary. After a time
they sat down on a log, and he lit
his pipe and tried to imagine an
environment of English oaks and
beeches. Again and more forcibly
he felt the discordance between the
English girl, simplified by generations
of discipline and homogeneous
traditions, and this green light,
this strange brooding silence, this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
vast solitude suggesting a new
world, a new race, an unimaginable
future, this hot electric sensuous
air.</p>

<p>They talked of the past two years
and of their future together.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have not told anyone yet that
we are engaged,&#8221; said Mary.
&#8220;People here don&#8217;t seem to take
things as seriously as we do, and I
could not stand being chaffed about
it. I have merely said that we
expected an old and dear friend of
the family.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am glad. It&#8217;s a bore to be
chaffed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course, I have written to all
our friends in England that we are
to be married on the twelfth. But
as the wedding is to be so quiet it
is not necessary to tell anyone
here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How do you like this country?&#8221;
he asked curiously. &#8220;I mean how<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
does it suit you personally? Of
course, I know you would make up
your mind to like any place where
duty happened to take you, but
you must have a private little idea
on the subject, and it is your duty
to tell me everything.&#8221;</p>

<p>She smiled happily. &#8220;&#8216;Well!&#8217; as
they say here, now that I am sure
that Edith will make papa comfortable,
I shall be glad enough to
go back to England. California
doesn&#8217;t suit me at all. It rubs me
the wrong way. I think I should
develop nerves if I stayed here much
longer. Americans don&#8217;t seem to me
to be half human. Helena Belmont
says that America will be the greatest
nation on earth when it gets a
soul, but that it is nothing but a
kicking squalling, precocious infant
at present; and that if some
one were clever enough to stick his
finger in the soft spot on the top of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
its head, it would transform it into
an idiot or a corpse; but that America
will pull though all right because
she has so many weak points that
her enemies forget which is the
weakest. Miss Belmont is so
clever. You will meet her on
Sunday. You don&#8217;t mind my having
accepted an invitation for you to
dine there?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not at all. It was very kind
of you, I am sure. I have heard of
this Miss Belmont; I don&#8217;t imagine
you find much in common with her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She horrifies me, but she fascinates
me more than any person I
have met here. I am sure she is a
good woman in spite of the reckless
things she does. Your friend Mr.
Rollins, says that she is the concentrated
essence of California, and I
always excuse her on that ground.
You never know what she is going
do or say next; and she is the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
most desperate flirt I ever heard of.
I suppose she is so beautiful she
can&#8217;t help it. Her eyes always
seem to be looking at you through
tears, even when they are laughing
or flirting, although I don&#8217;t believe
she sheds many. I cannot imagine
her crying, although I know her to
be kind-hearted, and generous, and
impulsive.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you call it kind-hearted to
throw fifteen men over?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I told her once that I thought it
was morally wrong for her to lure
men on to such a terrible awakening,
and she said that there was just
one thing that man didn&#8217;t know,
which was woman; and that it was
her duty to her sex to addle their
brains on the subject as much as
possible. But I want you to know
me, Owin.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The better I know you the better
I shall love you.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>&#8220;When your eyes laugh like that
I never know whether you are chaffing
me or not. It will not take
long, for I am not clever;&#8221; she
smiled a little sadly; &#8220;you are so
clever that I know you will often
want to go and talk to women who
know more than I do; but none of
them will ever love you so well.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know it,&#8221; he said tenderly,
and he believed what he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am glad that I have been in
California, though,&#8221; pursued Mary.
&#8220;It has broadened me. At home
we take it for granted that all the
unconventional people are bad, and
all the conventional ones good.
Here it is so different; although I
must say that I never heard so
much petty gossip and scandal in
my life as there is in the smart set
in San Francisco. All visitors
remark that; I suppose it is because
they have so little to do<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
and think about. It is very slow
here socially; and I suppose that is
what makes some of the women do
such outlandish things&mdash;that and
the country, for even the quiet ones
are not exactly like other people.
One can judge for oneself. I have
often pinned the tattlers down when
they were abusing Helena Belmont,
for instance, and they could not
verify a single statement.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Women know each other very
little,&#8221; said Clive.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">He</span> passed his nights in the Bohemian
Club camp, his mornings
in bed, the remaining hours wandering
about with his betrothed;
and felt that altogether life was not
understood by the pessimists. England,
with the struggles and cares
and responsibilities it held in store
for him, seemed to exist only between
the rusty covers of history,
and life a thing to be dawdled away
in a wonderful forest, where the
very air made a man hate the
thought of all that was hard and
ugly and too serious.</p>

<p>Clive was something more than
curious to see Miss Belmont again,
but hardly knew whether he ought
to go to her house or not. It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
was possible that she expected him
to decline an invitation proffered
before an unpleasant adventure;
but unless he pleaded sudden illness
he did not see his way out of
acceptance. On Saturday, however,
Mary received a note from
the ch&acirc;telaine of Casa del Norte,
reminding her of the dinner and of
her promise to bring Mr. Clive.</p>

<p>&#8220;Charley Rollins tells me that he
is the best all-round Englishman he
has ever known,&#8221; the note concluded;
&#8220;not the least bit of a cad.
I am most anxious to meet him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mary laughed as she handed the
note to Clive. &#8220;If any other
woman had written that I&#8217;d never
enter her house again. But, somehow,
you let her say and do exactly
what she chooses. The trouble is
that the only Englishmen she has
met have been fortune-hunters.
When we are married I&#8217;ll ask her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
over to visit us, and let her meet
men who are almost as perfect as
you are.&#8221;</p>

<p>Clive said &#8220;Yes, dear,&#8221; absently.
Three days of unshifting devotion
had blunted the fine point of his
content.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The next day Mary was prostrate
with one of the severe headaches to
which she was subject, and sent
Clive off with Charley Rollins to
the dinner.</p>

<p>&#8220;Go, go, my boy,&#8221; Mr. Gordon
had said to him, when Clive had
displayed a decent amount of reluctance;
&#8220;she&#8217;ll be too ill to be
spoken to for twenty-four hours.
You could do no good by hanging
round.&#8221;</p>

<p>During the hour&#8217;s drive through
the redwoods Clive said to Rollins,
&#8220;You are a great friend of Miss
Belmont, are you not?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>&#8220;I am, for a fact.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you known her long?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She nearly scratched my eyes
out when she was three and I five.
I&#8217;ve adored her ever since, and
think the reason I&#8217;ve been able to
hang on successfully is because I&#8217;ve
never proposed to her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve heard several opinions of
her, and I&#8217;d like yours. I can&#8217;t say
that, so far, I&#8217;ve met anyone likely
to understand her. You should,
particularly as you have never made
love to her.&#8221;</p>

<p>Rollins half closed his shrewd,
dark eyes, and tilted his hat over
his nose. Like all San Francisco
men, he looked carelessly dressed,
although in evening clothes, and
carried himself badly; but his face
was clear and refined, his hair and
beard trimly cut.</p>

<p>&#8220;Helena Belmont,&#8221; he said, in
what the club called his &#8220;summing-up<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
voice,&#8221; &#8220;has the genius of California
in her, like Sibyl Sanderson
and a dozen others I could mention
without stopping to think, although
they would be mere names to you.
You see, it is like this: all sorts of
men came here in early days&mdash;poor
men of good family who had failed
at home, or were too proud to work
there; desperadoes, adventurers,
men of middle life and broken fortunes&mdash;all
of them expecting everything
from the new land, and ready
to tear the heart out of anyone who
got in their way. It was every man
for himself and the devil take the
hindmost. Many succeeded. Some
of their methods will not bear the
fierce light of history. That savage
spirit, that instinct to trample to a
goal over anything or anybody, that
intolerance of restraint, still lingers
in the very atmosphere, and is
quick in the blood of many of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
the present generation, although,
strangely enough, it has given a
distincter individuality to the women
than to the men. Of course,
there are Californians and Californians.
It is always a mistake to
generalize too freely, but the type I
speak of is the most significant, although
you will find no Californian
exactly like any other American.
This is the land of the composite.
All America and all Europe have
emptied themselves into it. God
knows what it will sift down to
eventually&mdash;the commonplace, probably.
As for Helena Belmont, Jack
Belmont, her father, came here in
the fifties, and hung up his shingle.
He was one of the cleverest lawyers
the State has had. He rarely
drew a sober breath, and was never
seen to stagger; he was an inveterate
gambler, and a terror with
women. He married a Miss Lowell,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
of Boston, who came out here on a
visit&mdash;a beautiful girl; and God
knows what she went through with
him. You may be surprised that
she married him. I may have
given you the impression that he
was a cowboy in a red shirt and
sombrero. Jack Belmont was one
of the most elegant men this State
has ever seen, a gentleman when he
was drunkest, and the idol of the
Southern set, a strong contingent
here. There you have the elements
of which Helena Belmont is made
up. She has the blood of Cavaliers
and Roundheads in her veins; she
grew up amidst the clash of the
South against the North, for no two
people could ever have been more
unmated than her mother and
father; and she was born in California,
nurtured on its new savage
traditions, and mentally and temperamentally
fitted to draw in twice<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
her measure of its atmosphere. She
does what she pleases, because she
would never know if she were
beaten, has a tremendous personality
and a million dollars. Here we
are.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER V.</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> forest had ended abruptly.
They had come upon a large low
adobe house on a plateau, looking
down over a shelving table-land
upon the ocean, a mile below.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s about eighty years old,&#8221;
said Rollins, &#8220;which is antique in
this country. It belonged to one of
the grandees of the old time, and
Miss Belmont bought it shortly
after her father&#8217;s death. She has
several houses, but this is her favorite.
It has about thirty rooms,
and there have been some jolly good
times up here, I can tell you.
Those are the original tiles and the
original walls, but everything else
has been pretty well modernized,
except that old orchard you see on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
the other side and the vineyard and
rose-garden.&#8221;</p>

<p>They dismounted at an open gateway
in a high adobe wall, and entered
a large orderless garden. The
air was sweet with the delicate perfume
of Castilian roses, whose
green, thorny bushes, thick with
pink, rioted over the walls, up the
oaks, across the paths, and looked
as if no hand had cut or trimmed
them since the old Spaniard had
coaxed them from the soil, nearly a
century ago.</p>

<p>&#8220;She hates modern gardens,&#8221;
said Rollins, &#8220;and has never had a
gardener in this. We&#8217;d prefer to
walk without leaving ourselves in
shreds and patches on the thorns, but
if it suits her I suppose it&#8217;s all right.&#8221;</p>

<p>They entered the house opposite
a courtyard filled with palm-trees
and rustic chairs. A large curiously
modelled fountain, which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
Rollins told Clive was the work of
the old Franciscans, splashed lazily.
Several young men were swinging in
hammocks on the corridor which
traversed the four sides of the court.
A Chinese servant, in blouse and
pendant cue, was passing cocktails.</p>

<p>Rollins conducted Clive into a
small drawing-room, fitted in copper-colored
silken stuffs, and overlooking
the ocean. Neither Miss
Belmont nor her aunt was present,
and Rollins introduced Clive to the
assembled guests, with running footnotes
not intended for the ear of the
subject.</p>

<p>&#8220;Miss Lord&#8221;&mdash;presenting Clive
to a tall handsome, scornful-looking
girl. &#8220;She tears out reputations
with her teeth. Miss Carter&mdash;a
clever little snob, who is a joy to
flirt with because you know she is
too selfish to fall in love with you.
Mrs. Lent&mdash;an army flirt, who has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
done much to educate the youth of
San Francisco. Mrs. Volney&mdash;a
widow with a commanding talent
for marrying and burying rich husbands.
Miss Leonard&mdash;who plays
better than any woman in San Francisco,
which is saying a good deal;
a lovely girl, if a trifle cold. Mrs.
Tower&mdash;a really charming young
widow, with a voice as fiery as her
eyes. Miss West&mdash;who is half
Spanish, a good deal of a prude, and
a most accomplished flirt. Here
comes Mrs. Cartright, who has the
honor of being Miss Belmont&#8217;s
aunt, chaperon, and slave.&#8221;</p>

<p>A middle-aged lady&mdash;small, stout,
but with much dignity of bearing,
her dark face refined and gentle&mdash;entered,
and greeted Clive with the
rich Southern brogue which twenty
years of California had not tempered.
As he exchanged platitudes
with her she reminded him of a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
gentle breeze which had wandered
aimlessly in, barely touching his
cheek. She talked incessantly, and
wholly without consequence.</p>

<p>Clive had created a perceptible
flutter among the women. Being a
shy man, he was painfully aware
that every eye in the room was
upon him, and that he was being discussed
behind more than one fan.
The other men&mdash;society youths&mdash;had
entered, and looked crude and
new beside him. He had the
straight figure of the athlete, and
carried his clothes in a manner
which made Rollins feel, as he confided
to Miss Carter, like hitching up
his trousers. His closely cut hair
was almost black; his moustache
the color of straw, and as uneven
as frequent conflagrations could
make it, fell over a delicately-cut,
strong, mobile mouth. It had taken
many generations to breed his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
profile&mdash;so delicate and sensitive
was it, yet so strong. His eyes
were grey and well set, full of
humour and fire. The chin and
neck were a trifle heavy. There
was something very splendid about
the whole appearance of the man,
and he filled the eye whenever he
stood in a room.</p>

<p>Mrs. Cartwright&#8217;s fluttering attention
having been deflected elsewhere,
he plunged his hands into
his pockets and talked to Mrs. Volney,
whose <i>cr&ecirc;pe</i> set off a pair of
shoulders of which he approved.
She was a remarkably pretty woman,
with large innocent-looking green
eyes and golden hair, and conversed
with a babyish inflection which he
thought very fetching. In a moment
he forgot her, and went toward
the door with Rollins. Miss Belmont
had entered.</p>

<p>The pink color in her face<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
flamed for a moment, but her eyes
lit with an admiration so unmistakable
that Clive, too, colored and
laughed nervously. He wondered
if his eyes were as frank as hers.
Her tall slim figure was very round;
the delicate neck carried no superfluous
flesh, but was apparently boneless.
The small proud head was
poised well back. Clive knew her
features; but the rich mahogany-brown
hair, crisp and electric, and
curling unmanageably, the dark
blue eyes, the warm whiteness of
skin, the pink of cheek and lips,
were the splendid finish of a hasty
sketch. Her white gown was of
some silken stuff embroidered with
silver, and pearls were in her hair
and about her throat. She looked
as proud and calm and well-conducted
as a young empress.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course this is Mr. Clive,&#8221;
she said. &#8220;You are not at all necessary,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
Charley. I am so sorry Miss
Gordon is ill. Give me your arm;
dinner is ready. I know that you
have not told anyone,&#8221; she murmured,
as they walked down the
corridor.</p>

<p>&#8220;How do you know? It is a
good story, and I may have told it
all over the place.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am sure you have not even
told it to Miss Gordon.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why Miss Gordon?&#8221; he asked,
smiling into her frankly curious
eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you engaged to her?&#8221;</p>

<p>He laughed but made no reply.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe you are,&#8221; she
said abruptly, after they were
seated. &#8220;You don&#8217;t look the least
bit as if anyone owned you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why did you make an English
room of this? It might have been
taken bodily out of some old manor
house. These Chinamen in it are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
an anomaly. I should have thought
you would rather preserve the
character of the country.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The old Californians had no
taste whatever about interiors&mdash;whitewashed
walls and hair cloth
furniture. Besides, we have just
about as much of California out
here as we can stand, and like to
import something else into it occasionally.&#8221;</p>

<p>There were eighteen people at
table. The conversation was principally
about other people. Occasionally,
a current novel or play
captured a few moments&#8217; attention,
but the talk soon swung triumphantly
back to personalities.
Clive had never seen so many
pretty women together. One or
two were beautiful. The dense
blackness of Mrs. Tower&#8217;s hair, the
red and olive of her skin, the high,
cheek bones, inadvertently modelled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
features and fierce eyes suggested
Indian ancestry. Miss
West&#8217;s soft Spanish eyes languished
or coquetted, but there was a New
England meagreness about her
mouth. Miss Leonard, with her
<i>cendr&eacute;</i> hair, and cold regular features
might have had all the blood
of all the Howards in her. Mrs.
Lent had a dark piquant Franco-American
face. Miss Carter was
very small, very dignified, with
large cool intelligent grey eyes,
abundant yellow hair, and an Irish
nose and upper lip. All had the
slight bust and generous development
of hip and leg peculiar to the
Californian women. The men interested
Clive less: they looked very
ordinary society youths, and he
wondered if Rollins could not dispose
of them collectively in an epigram.</p>

<p>He quarrelled intermittently with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
Miss Belmont: they did not hit it
off. Nevertheless, he wondered if
it could be the rashling he had met
in the forest. She still wore her regal
air and would have looked as
cold as one of the fine marbles in
her drawing-room, had it not been
for her lavish coloring. She took
little part in the general conversation,
and he said to her abruptly&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;These people don&#8217;t seem to interest
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m tired to death of them. I&#8217;ll
turn them all out presently. I
bought this place to be near the redwoods,
which I love better than
anything in the world, and I like to
entertain by fits and starts. I
spent last winter here alone.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I should like to have known
you then. When you get time to
think about yourself you must be a
charming egoist.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have the most impertinent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
tongue and the most flirtatious eyes
I have ever met.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where is the man you are engaged
to?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Up at Shasta and the lava beds.
He will be back in a few days. You
will like him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is he a good fellow?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; with friendly enthusiasm;
&#8220;an awfully good fellow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t love him, though.&#8221;</p>

<p>Her lashes half met&mdash;a habit they
had. &#8220;No,&#8221; she said, &#8220;I don&#8217;t
believe I do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Helena! Helena!&#8221; cried Rollins.
&#8220;Clive, I feel it my duty to tell
you that she is engaged, and for the
fifteenth time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He has been telling me that I
am not in love with Mr. Van Rhuys,
and intimating that he has come just
in time to save me from a fatal
mistake.&#8221;</p>

<p>She looked charmingly impertinent,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
her eyes half closed, her chin
lifted, her pink lips pouting from
their classic lines.</p>

<p>Clive was somewhat taken aback,
but replied promptly, &#8220;If I disclaim,
it is from timidity, not lack of gallantry:
I fear I should learn more
than I have the power to teach.&#8221;</p>

<p>Everybody laughed. Miss Belmont&#8217;s
eyes sparkled. &#8220;You
mean,&#8221; she said, when the attention
of the others was once more
diverted, &#8220;that you are not going
to fall in love with me. Everybody
does, you know. I never mind surrounding
myself with beautiful
women, because I am much more
fascinating than any of them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am hopelessly unoriginal, but
I shall make a desperate effort this
time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why do you say that? You
look quite unlike anyone I have
ever seen; I mean quite a different<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
person looks out of your eyes.&#8221;
Her own eyes had a frankly speculative
regard devoid of coquetry.
Clive&#8217;s masculine vanity warmed.</p>

<p>&#8220;You read a great deal, I hear,&#8221;
he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;What an extraordinary way you
have of ignoring what a person says
to you. Are you absent-minded, or
deaf, or merely impolite?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Merely an Englishman.&#8221;</p>

<p>Miss Belmont&#8217;s color deepened.
Clive&#8217;s eyes invoked a ridiculous
picture of a stately young <i>ch&acirc;telaine</i>
kicking and struggling in an Englishman&#8217;s
arms.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why do the people of your
country take pride in being rude?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They don&#8217;t. They don&#8217;t bother
about trifles like the men of several
other nations, that is all. I&#8217;ll open
the door for you when you leave the
room, and even take off my hat in
the lift and catch a cold in my head,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
but don&#8217;t expect me to find a reply
to all the nonsense a woman chooses
to talk, if a more interesting subject
occurs to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you very haughty and supercilious,
or are you very shy?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What does that mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I mean that you were flattered
to death by what I said, and
changed the subject, as a girl would
blush or stammer.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I suspect you are right.&#8221; He
rose to let her pass. His eyes
laughed down into hers, and she
felt the sudden content of a child
when it is noticed by a person of
superior years and stature.</p>

<p>&#8220;That man has the most charming
eyes I ever saw,&#8221; she said, as
the dining-room door closed behind
the women. &#8220;I don&#8217;t believe they
ever could be sober.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just observe his lower jaw,&#8221; said
Mrs. Volney, with her infantile lisp.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VI.</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">When</span> the men left the dining-room
they found the women in the
patio, or scattered about the corridor.
There was no moon, but the
clear sky blazed with stars, and
colored lanterns swung between
the pillars or among the broad
leaves of the palm-trees. The girls
(the married women were little
more) had thrown lace or silken
scarves over their heads, and fluttered
their fans idly. Clive recalled
all he had read of the old time, and
imagined himself back among the
careless dons and do&ntilde;as who lived
for little but pleasure, and had not
a prescience of the complex civilization
to enter their Arcadia and rout
its very memory.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>Miss Belmont was sitting on the
corridor, leaning over the low balustrade,
her hands lightly clasped.
She had draped a white lace mantilla
about her head, and looked more
Spanish than Miss West. It
seemed to Clive that she had a
faculty of looking whatever she
wished. Someone handed her a
guitar. She leaned against the
pillar and tuned it absently. Clive
walked over and stood staring down
on her, his hands in his pockets.
She sang, in a rich contralto voice,
a Spanish song, whose words he
could not understand, but which
was the most passionate he had
ever heard. Her head was thrown
back. She sang frankly to Clive;
her face changed with every line.</p>

<p>When it was over Mrs. Cartright
breathed a plaintive sigh. &#8220;That&#8217;s
the handsomest song that Helena
sings,&#8221; she announced.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>Helena arose abruptly. &#8220;Come,&#8221;
she said to Clive. &#8220;Let us go for a
walk.&#8221;</p>

<p>He followed her out into the
rose-garden. There were no lanterns
here, and it looked wilder
than by day. The air was very
warm and sweet. Helena plucked
one of the pink Castilian roses, and
fastened back her mantilla with it,
exposing a charming ear.</p>

<p>&#8220;You will never find any occupation
so becoming to your hands,&#8221; said
Clive dutifully. &#8220;Are your feet as
perfect?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They are something to dream
of,&#8221; said Miss Belmont flippantly.</p>

<p>They went out on to the terrace.
The ocean pounded monotonously,
tossing spray high into the air.
Clive looked at his companion.
Her head was thrown back, her lips
were slightly apart. She looked
like a woman who held a ball of fire<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>
between her finger-tips, and toyed
with it caressingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Shall we walk along the cliffs?&#8221;</p>

<p>She hesitated a moment. &#8220;No;
let us go into the forest.&#8221;</p>

<p>As they entered they were
greeted by a rush of cool perfumed
air, the scent of wild lilac and lily,
the strong bracing odor of redwood
and pine. For a hundred yards or
more there was little brush; the
great trees stood far apart; but as
they left the plateau and ascended
a narrow trail, the young redwoods
and ferns and lilacs grew thick. It
was a hard pull and they said little.
He helped her up the almost perpendicular
ascent, over fallen trees
and rocks, and huge roots springing
across the path like pythons,
and wondered if they were penetrating
wilds hitherto sacred to the
red man. Presently the low roar of
water greeted them, and pushing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
their way through a small grove of
ferns they came upon the high bank
of a broad creek. Beyond and
around rose the dark rigid forest,
but into the opening the stars flung
plentiful light. They revealed the
clear rapid rush of water over huge
stones and logs that looked like
living things, great bunches of maiden-hair
springing from dripping
boulders, the dark mysterious perspective
of the creek.</p>

<p>Clive did not wonder if he would
lose his head. He had no intention
of keeping it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sit down,&#8221; she said, arranging
herself on a fallen pine and leaning
against a redwood. Clive made
himself as comfortable as he could,
and she gave him permission to
light his pipe.</p>

<p>The lace mantilla, in spite of
brush and briar, still clung to her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
head and shoulders. She looked
very lovely and womanly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why did you bring me here?&#8221;
he asked. &#8220;You told me the other
night that you would never trust
yourself alone with me. This is
equivalent to saying that you want
me to make love to you. I am quite
ready.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How brutally abrupt you are.
I don&#8217;t want you to make love to
me. I meant to tell you before we
started that I did not expect it.
Most women do, I know, and it must
be such a relief to a man to be let
off occasionally.&#8221; She opened and
closed her large fan, with a graceful
motion of the wrist, and then turned
and looked straight at him. &#8220;I
have never walked alone with a man
in this forest before,&#8221; she said;
&#8220;neither at night nor in the daytime.
It would have been spoiled for me
if I had.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>He pulled at his pipe. &#8220;You are
a very brave woman. If what you
say is true, what is your reason for
bringing me here?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I felt a desire to do so, and I always
obey my whims.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You know that my vanity is
touched to the quick. But will you
tell me why you are doing all you
can to turn my head, if you don&#8217;t
want me to make love to you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do want you to.&#8221;</p>

<p>Clive laid down his pipe.</p>

<p>&#8220;No! It would be a pity to let
it go out, and it might set my forest
on fire. Do let me finish.
Women are not like men. A man is
fascinated by a woman, and his one
impulse is to get at her, and without
loss of time; a woman may have
the same impulse, but the dislike of
being won too quickly, the desire to
be sure of herself, above all, the
wish to make the man more serious&mdash;all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
these things hold her back.
So I don&#8217;t want you to make love to
me to-night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Which means that I may later?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know. That will depend
on a good many things, one of
which is whether I break my engagement
with Schuyler Van Rhuys or
not. I have some slight sense of
honor.&#8221;</p>

<p>Clive colored hotly, and for the
moment his ardor left him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you thinking of breaking it
off?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Somewhat.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it true that you have been
engaged fifteen times?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No; only eight. I have not yet
discovered that there are fifteen
interesting men in the world. I
have only met nine.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You can flatter charmingly.
But you say you have a sense of
honor. What would you think of a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
man who deceived and jilted eight
girls?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is quite different with a man:
women are so helpless. But when
a woman has the reputation of being
fickle, men know what to expect and
propose with their eyes open. As
a matter of fact, there is not an
atom of the flirt in me; of coquetry,
perhaps, for I have an irrepressible
desire to please the man who has
pleased me. To most men I am
clay. I am doing all I can to fascinate
you, and I shall continue to do
so. I engaged myself to each of
those eight men, honestly believing
that I could love him&mdash;that I had
found a companion. If I ever suffered
the delusion that any one of
them was my <i>grande passion</i>, the delusion
was brief. Still, I gave up all
idea of that some years ago. With
each of those men I set myself honestly
to work to get into sympathy,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
and to love him. Of course, you
will understand that I had been
more or less fascinated in each
case. If a man has not magnetism
for me, he might have every other
quality given to mortal, and he
would not attract my passing interest.
Well, I could not find anything
in any one of them to get hold
of. One cannot love a clever
mind, nor personal magnetism,
nor a charming trick of manner,
nor a kind heart; nor all. There
is something else. One hates to
be sentimental, but I suppose
what those men have lacked is soul.
Our men don&#8217;t seem to have time
for that. It isn&#8217;t in the make-up
of this country. Perhaps I haven&#8217;t
it; but, at all events, I have a mental
conception of it, and know that
it is what I want.&#8221;</p>

<p>Clive puffed at his pipe for a moment.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>&#8220;Are you talking pretty nonsense,&#8221;
he asked, &#8220;or do you mean
that?&#8221;</p>

<p>She turned her head away angrily.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are just like other men,&#8221;
she said. &#8220;I have always been
laughed or stared at by every man I
have ever had the courage to broach
the subject to. I was a fool to
speak to you. It is two or three
years since I let myself go like this.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not laughing. It is a very
serious subject: the most serious in
life. Girls and men and minor
poets are always prating of it, but
it is a good subject to keep quiet
about until you understand it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you think I understand
it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think you will some time&mdash;yes,
certainly. And you had better not
marry Mr. Van Rhuys.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We are so new,&#8221; she said, leaning<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
her elbows on her knees, her
chin on her clasped hands. &#8220;It
is as if the Almighty had flung a
lot of brilliant particles together,
which cohered symmetrically, and
so quickly that the spiritual essence
of the universe had no time to crawl
inside. I stayed here last winter
by myself trying to solve the problem
of life, but I only addled my
brain. I read and read and read,
and thought and thought and
thought, and in the end I felt sadder,
but not wiser.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t find it alone.&#8221;</p>

<p>She flushed, and he saw her eyes
deepen.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then Schuyler Van Rhuys
turned up, and I concluded that the
best thing I could do was to go to
New York and cut a dash in the
smart set. And he is such a good
fellow. He would fight superbly if
there were a war; he would carry<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
me safely out of a mob; he would
always be kind, and in a manner
companionable, for he is well up on
affairs and current art and literature.
I should like you to know him, for
he is one of the best types of American
you will ever meet. But&mdash;there
is nothing else. And I am
the stronger of the two. There is
nothing as solitary as that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t marry him. You have no
excuse&mdash;at your age and with your
brain. Wait until you find the right
man, even if it is a million years
hence.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;ve heard that&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; She
paused abruptly. &#8220;It isn&#8217;t like you
to talk exaggerated nonsense. What
did you mean by that last?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What I said.&#8221;</p>

<p>Her lip curled. &#8220;You don&#8217;t mean
to say that you believe in a life
after this&mdash;you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>&#8220;Well, do explain.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see why any belief of mine
should interest you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But it does. Tell me!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This is not my hour for lecturing.
I&#8217;d much rather talk about you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, please don&#8217;t be unhumanly
modest. Go on, you&#8217;ve roused my
curiosity now, and I will know what
you think.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well. Not being an unreasoning
oyster, I believe in a future
state. Not in the old-fashioned
business, of course; but if a man has
ever thought, and if he has had two
or three generations of thinking ancestors
behind him, he hardly believes
that the scheme of creation
is so purposeless as to turn people
of progressive development loose
on one unsatisfactory plane, only.&#8221;
Clive spoke rapidly when he spoke
at length, but paused abruptly every
now and again, then resumed without<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
impulsion. &#8220;What would be the
object? What meaning? Everything
else in the scheme of creation
has a meaning, leads to something
definite.... That is the significance
of the lack of soul you
search for in a race of men that
have not yet had time to develop
it&mdash;who are yet surely progressing
toward such a consummation....
On this earth it takes generations of
leisure, of art, of literature, of
science, but mainly of individual
thinking, to develop the subtle combination
which puts man in relation
with the divine principle in the universe.
The pre-eminent development
of England over all other nations
is as indisputable as it is natural.
What would be the object of
such mental and spiritual development
if this incomplete life of ours
were all? We go on afterward, of
course; ascending by slow and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
laborious evolution, from plane to
plane.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And about the other thing?
You believe that in one existence or
another you meet the person who
satisfies you in all things&mdash;your
other part?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps two in a century meet
in this existence. But most of us
don&#8217;t&mdash;for centuries. Perhaps millions
of centuries. Time is nothing.
Your man may not be born here for
several centuries&mdash;but you will find
him some time. And when you do,
you and he will become biunial&mdash;one
in a sense that I believe passes
all understanding here&mdash;except, perhaps,
that of the one or two fortunate
ones of each century or so....
The ancients had some such idea
when they took Eve out of Adam.&#8221;</p>

<p>Helena rose and went to the edge
of the creek. She stood there without
speaking for ten minutes, kicking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
stones down into the water.
Then she turned about.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have always looked upon that
sort of thing as poetical rot,&#8221; she
said; &#8220;beneath the consideration of
anyone of the higher order of intelligence;
probably because in this
country, particularly in this State,
everything occult, except religion,
and sometimes that, is enveloped
fifteen times over in vulgar and
mercenary fraud. Even well written
treatises on such subjects have
never interested me&mdash;my American
intolerance of anything which cannot
be demonstrated, I suppose.
But if a man like you believes, it
makes one think.&#8221;</p>

<p>She came and sat close beside him
on the log, her gown brushing his
feet.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is true&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; she began.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is hardly fair, you know,&#8221;
said Clive.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>&#8220;What?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You know as well as I do. If I
am not to make love to you&mdash;and in
a way you have placed me on my
honor&mdash;go and sit at the other end
of the log.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Pshaw! After what you have
just said, you should be above such
things.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not a spirit yet, please remember.
And I am not by any
means so highly developed as I ought
to be. If you don&#8217;t go away I shall
take hold of you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Helena went back to her former
position.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Delilah becomes you,&#8221; he
pursued, &#8220;until one realizes that it is
not you at all. You look the most
womanly of women now that you
have forgotten you brought me here
to make a fool of me&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I did not! Indeed, I did not.
I brought you here because I wanted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
to talk to you in this forest, and because
the moment I saw you I recognized
something in you that I have
found in no other man.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You take great risks, Miss Belmont;
I should seize and kiss you
after that remark, and you know it.
To-morrow you will think me an ass
because I did not, and I am.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I want to talk some more about
that other thing. I thought, as I
stood by the creek, of our literature.
Has it occurred to you that no American
author has ever written a genuine
all-round love scene? They are
either thin or sensual, almost invariably
the former. The soul and passion
of the older races they have
never developed. If a woman writer
breaks out wildly sometimes, she
merely voices the lack we all feel in
this section of the world&mdash;in life as
well as in literature. That explains
why I have tried to care for eight<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
clever and interesting men and
turned away chilled.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You must love an Englishman,&#8221;
said Clive, smiling. &#8220;If you notice,
a good many American women do.
An Englishwoman never marries an
American. It goes to prove what
I said a little while ago: leisure is
needed for development; consequently
the women of America have
developed far more rapidly than
the men.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t imagine for a moment
that I am disparaging my own country,&#8221;
said Helena hurriedly; &#8220;I am
the best American in the world&mdash;I
wouldn&#8217;t be anything else; and I
like and admire our men for their
cleverness and pluck and wonderful
go-aheadness. But I will confide
to you something that I have
never told a living soul&mdash;I have
such a contempt for the Anglomaniac
that I have a horror of being<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>
taken for one. It is this: something
English in me has survived
through five generations. I was
brought up in a library of English
literature; perhaps that fostered
it. As long as I merely read and
studied I lived in imagination
among English scenes and people&mdash;the
people of your history and
those created by your authors and
poets. Something in me responded
to every line that I read; I felt
at home; singularly enough much
more so than when I finally visited
England. Until a few years ago I
could not force myself to read
American literature&mdash;with the sole
exception of Bret Harte. It is so
cold, so slight, so forbidding. It is
the piano of letters. Now, of
course, I appreciate the mentality
in it and the delicate art, the light
rapid sketches of passing phases.
And it seems to me that before we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
produce a Shakspere or Byron we
shall have to relapse into barbarism,
and emerge and develop by slow
and sure stages to the condition of
England when she evolved her
great men. We have gone ahead
too fast to ever become great
from our present beginnings; we
are all brilliant shallows and no
depths.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You disprove a good deal that
you say.&#8221;</p>

<p>Helena bent forward, pressing
her chin hard into the palm of her
hand. She had forgotten that she
was a beautiful woman, but even so
she was graceful.</p>

<p>&#8220;If we Californians have a
stronger fibre and richer blood in us
than other Americans,&#8221; she replied,
&#8220;it is because we are cruder, savager,
close to nature. I do things
that no Eastern girl in the same social
position would even think of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
doing, much less dare; but, on the
other hand, I have a better chance
of getting what I want out of life,
for I go straight for it, undeterred
by any traditions or scruples. And
I have more to give.&#8221;</p>

<p>She paused and Clive filled and lit
another pipeful of tobacco.</p>

<p>&#8220;You take great satisfaction out
of that pipe,&#8221; she said pettishly.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is my only safeguard.&#8221;</p>

<p>She laughed and he could see her
flush.</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose that English something
in me, which has survived,
was what sprang so instantly to you&mdash;recognition.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have been in England, and
you have met many Englishmen.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have liked some of them tremendously,
although I never would
admit it, and always bullyragged
them; that mixture of subtlety and
brutality is very attractive. But<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
it was not the same&mdash;not by any
means.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You force me to repeat that
you take very great risks.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no,&#8221; she said plaintively.
&#8220;How could I? I am not what
you imagined me. But I must stay
here and talk to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>They talked until the night
turned grey, drifting no more
toward personalities. Then Clive
looked at his watch.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you know what time it is?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not in the least care.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is three o&#8217;clock. And I can
see that you are tired. Come!&#8221;</p>

<p>She rose and he jerked her shawl
across her chest and threw one
end over her shoulder. &#8220;What a
silly child you are to come out
with that bare neck. Aren&#8217;t you
chilled?&#8221;</p>

<p>She smiled up at him as gratefully<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
as if unused to the tender care
of man.</p>

<p>They went down the mountain
without further conversation; it
was very dark and steep; a mis-step
might have sent one or both
headlong.</p>

<p>The house was without lights;
even the lanterns on the corridors
had burned out. As they entered
the court a man rose from a long
chair, yawning and stretching himself.
It was Charley Rollins.</p>

<p>&#8220;My God, Helena!&#8221; he exclaimed,
&#8220;this is going too far.
You know that all of us who know
you swear by you, but you can&#8217;t do
this sort of thing with such women
as Mrs. Volney and Harriet Lord in
the house. Sitting up all night under
a tree in full view of all Del
Monte is one thing, but the middle
of a forest, where you have never
taken a man in the daytime before&mdash;for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
heaven&#8217;s sake, my dear child,
have a care.&#8221;</p>

<p>He ended rather feebly; for Helena
had brought down her foot and
thrown back her head with flashing
eyes. &#8220;I shall do exactly what I
choose to do,&#8221; she cried. &#8220;And I
hope Amy Volney and Harriet
Lord have their heads out of their
doors this minute. What business
is it of yours, I should like to know?
How dare you take me to task?
Take Mr. Clive over to the dining-room,
and give him some brandy,
and then go home; or stay all
night if you choose; there are two
empty rooms at the corner. Good-night,
Mr. Clive.&#8221; And without
taking further notice of Rollins she
crossed over to the opposite corridor
and disappeared.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clive</span> and Rollins exchanged few
words on the drive home. Miss
Belmont&#8217;s name was not mentioned.
Clive&#8217;s feelings were mixed. He
candidly admitted that his vanity
was profoundly at peace with itself,
and that Helena Belmont was
the most interesting woman he had
ever met. Nevertheless, his conscience
chattered at his vanity like
an angry monkey at a peacock.</p>

<p>&#8220;I feel exactly like a delinquent
husband,&#8221; he thought. &#8220;Premonitory,
I suppose. I have an absurdly
married feeling; the result of a
long engagement, probably, and a
lifelong acquaintance.... I wonder
if a man ever bothers if the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
woman is not likely to find him
out; I can&#8217;t say it has ever worried
me much before. I suppose it&#8217;s on
the principle that what a woman
doesn&#8217;t know won&#8217;t hurt her.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then he wondered if he would
have sat up all night with another
woman had he been engaged to
Helena Belmont.</p>

<p>He made his confession three
days later, when Mary was fully
recovered.</p>

<p>She smiled a little sadly, the smile
which seems to belong to the lips
of such women, fashioned to be
good wives and mothers, and nothing
more. She put up her hand and
touched his hair shyly; she seldom
caressed him.</p>

<p>&#8220;She is always sitting up all night
with some one or other. It seems
to be a fad of hers. And you know
I trust you absolutely.&#8221; (He had
the grace to blush.) &#8220;But, I think,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
if you don&#8217;t mind, that I&#8217;ll announce
the engagement.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, of course I don&#8217;t mind,&#8221;
he said, taken aback. &#8220;It was
your idea to keep it quiet, not mine.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; but I think I&#8217;d like her to
know.&#8221;</p>

<p>As Clive left the cottage he met
Rollins.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have something to tell you,
old chap,&#8221; he said awkwardly. &#8220;I
want you to congratulate me. I
am engaged to Miss Gordon.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The devil you are!&#8221; exclaimed
Rollins slapping him vigorously on
the back, &#8220;I do congratulate you,
old fellow, she&#8217;s a jewel of a girl.
Going to marry here?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, in San Francisco.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The club will give you a send-off
the night before. You won&#8217;t
look as handsome on your wedding-morn
as you otherwise might, and
you&#8217;ll have a dark brown taste in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>
your mouth, but in a long period of
domestic bliss you&#8217;ll have a great
joy to look back upon.&#8221;</p>

<p>They walked down to the camp
together, then Rollins left abruptly
and returning to Yorba went to the
telephone office.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VIII.</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Helena Belmont</span> saw little of her
company for two days. She spent
part of the time in the forest, the
rest in her boudoir, a long room on
the east side of the house opening
into her bedroom at one end and
into a small library at the other.
The bedroom was a pretty thing of
pale pink and green, and white lace.
The library, lined from floor to ceiling
with books, many several generations
old, had only a rug on the
bare floor, a table and several upright
chairs. The walls of the boudoir
were panelled with the beautiful
delicately-veined redwood the forest
trees conceal under their forbidding
bark. The ceiling was arched<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>
and heavily beamed. The curtains
of doors and windows, the deep
chairs and couches, the rugs on the
dark floor were of Smyrna stuffs
whose only tangible color was a red
that was almost black. A redwood
mantel was built to the ceiling; a
large table of the same wood, heavily
carved, was covered with books
and costly trifles. The deep window
seats were also upholstered.
The Castilian roses nodded against
the pane, but Helena could look
above the garden wall into the forest
on the mountain.</p>

<p>And here Helena sat for hours.
She was profoundly stirred and
touching lightly the keys of something
akin to happiness. Several
times before in her life she had felt
what she believed to be the quickening
of love; but it had died in its
swaddling clothes, and had been a
vagary of the fancy to this. Her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>
brain and her woman&#8217;s instinct told
her unerringly that she had found the
man. Every part of her went out to
him. A faint sweet something tipped
her pulses. It is possible that
passion was regnant at this time;
that she was possessed by the savage
primitive desire of the first woman
for the first man; so far she had
come in contact with little beyond
the man&#8217;s powerful personality and
responsive magnetism. Nevertheless
there had been spiritual recognition,
blind and groping as it may
have been; certain torpid instincts
stirred, and she divined vaguely
what a woman might be to her husband.
She had known many married
women more or less intimately,
been the confidante of more than
one liaison; and with intuition fostered
by such knowledge and her
own strong brain, she rejoiced that
she had met him in time, divining<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>
something of the bitter sadness
which companions a woman, who,
meeting a man too late, must be
one thing to him, instead of
twenty: his wife would still have
the better part of his life, his higher
nature, his duty, the supreme happiness
of making his home.</p>

<p>She dreamed dreams of her future
with Clive: the love and the art by
which she would hold him, the companionship.
She forgot Mary Gordon&#8217;s
existence. Had she remembered,
she would have imperiously
dismissed the very thought of her.
She had obtained what she wanted
all her life, and recognized no
obstacles.</p>

<p>She went up to the log by the
creek and touched caressingly the
tree against which he had leaned,
gathered some of the ashes from his
pipe and held them in the hollow of
her hand. She smiled as she did so,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>
and wondered that clever women
and silly women should be so little
dissimilar when in love.</p>

<p>It was on the morning of the third
day that the Chinese butler tapped
at her door, and said&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Lollins wantee you at telephone,
missee.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, tell somebody else to answer
him. I am tired of the very
sound of that telephone. Someone
is at it all day. I&#8217;ve a great mind to
have it taken out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Allight, missee.&#8221;</p>

<p>A few moments later he returned.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Lollins slay he got something
velly important tellee missee.&#8221;</p>

<p>Helena went rapidly to the little
room by the front door sacred to
the telephone. The fear shook her
that something had happened to
Clive.</p>

<p>She sat down by the table and
rang the bell.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>&#8220;Halloo!&#8221; she said faintly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Halloo, Helena! is that you?&#8221;
came Rollins&#8217; hearty, reassuring
voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. What do you want? I
wish you wouldn&#8217;t bother me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Awfully sorry, but I&#8217;ve a piece
of news for you&mdash;a corker.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s about your Englishman.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My Englishman? What Englishman?
What nonsense are you
talking?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, come off. I&#8217;ve terrible
news for you. I&#8217;ve just congratulated
him. He&#8217;s mortgaged.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish you would not talk slang
over the telephone. I suppose you
mean he&#8217;s engaged to Mary Gordon.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the hard cold fact.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, please congratulate them
for me. I&#8217;ll give them a dinner.
I&#8217;ll write a note to-day&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>&#8220;You&#8217;ll see him to-night. I hope
you haven&#8217;t forgotten that you are
all to dine with us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I had forgotten it, but we&#8217;ll be
there.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Great Scott, Helena! have you
also forgotten that this is our last
night, and that you asked six of us
to spend a week with you? Are
those boys still there?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They are; but I&#8217;ll send them
home this minute. I&#8217;m awfully
sorry I forgot it, but everything
will be ready for you. I&#8217;ll send a
wagon over for your traps this
afternoon, and the char-&agrave;-banc will
bring you back to-night. Now,
clear out, I have a great deal to attend
to.&#8221;</p>

<p>Helena replaced the trumpet
carefully in its bracket, then leaned
her elbows on the table and laughed.
The one sensation of which she was
definitely conscious for the moment<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
was genuine amusement. She recalled
her dreams, her pictured life
with Clive, and felt a fool; but she
had always been able to laugh at
herself, and she did so now. In a
little while she went into the corridors,
where the guests were dawdling
after their morning drive.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Mes enfants</i>,&#8221; she said, blowing
a kiss from the tips of her fingers to
each of the young men in turn, &#8220;go
straightway and pack up. You are
to go home on the 4.10. I asked, a
week ago, six of the club men to
come here to-night, and you must
vacate. And, what do you think?
My Englishman is engaged to Mary
Gordon.&#8221;</p>

<p>She ruffled her hair with a tragic
little gesture, threw up her hands
and disappeared.</p>

<p>It was not long before the humor
died out of her. In its wake came
the profoundest depression she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>
had ever known. She looked into
a blank and colorless future, realizing
that a woman may be young
until fifty if it is still her privilege
to seek and wait and hope, but that
when her great joy has touched and
passed her, she has buried all that
is best of her youth.</p>

<p>She could not stay in her rooms,
eloquent of imaginings, but went
back to her guests, and clung to
them and talked of what interested
them, and had never been more hospitable
and charming; all the while
mechanically counting the years and
months and days that lay ahead of
her. The depression lasted for
hours, during which she wondered
if the weight in her brain was crushing
the light and reason out of it.</p>

<p>And then the devil entered into
her.</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IX.</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> girls in their gayest muslin
frocks, chaperoned by the more
sedate Mrs. Cartwright, arrived at
the camp at seven. A long table
was spread under the redwoods
near the bank of the little river, in
whose falls bottles lay cooling.
Clive was the only other guest.
Mary Gordon had been asked; but
although she had accepted with
philosophy much that was Californian,
the informalities of the
Bohemian Club were more than
she could stand. Clive had been
begged to go alone and to stay
as late as he liked.</p>

<p>Helena wore a pink muslin frock,
her hair in a loose braid. Her eyes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
were dancing. She looked like a
naughty child, and chattered clever
nonsense, apparently in the highest
of spirits.</p>

<p>An impromptu band played softly
out of sight; one could hear the
splashing of the river and the faint
music of the redwoods. Chinese
lanterns, suspended in a row over
the table, and from the young redwoods,
gave abundant light. It was
a very informal dinner. The men
wore flannel shirts, smoked when it
pleased them, and assumed any attitude
conducive to comfort. Clive
tipped back his chair against a tree,
and felt that it was his duty to rejoice
that Mary was not present.
Every man waited on himself and
on the guests of honor. Helena, at
the head of the table, had the one
servant constantly at her elbow.
It was her tendency to spoil the
men she liked, and she encouraged<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>
her Bohemians in all their transgressions;
which was one of the
many reasons why they liked her
better than any woman in California.</p>

<p>A course not pleasing her taste,
she called for her guitar and sang
for them a rollicking song of the
bull-fight. Clive leaned forward on
the table and watched her: her
nostrils expanded as if they had the
scent of blood in them; she curled
her lips under, clicking her teeth.
Her eyes had not wandered to Clive
since, upon entering the camp, she
had prettily congratulated him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Helena, you alarm me,&#8221; said
Rollins mildly, when she finished.
&#8220;I haven&#8217;t seen you look as
wicked as you do to-night for several
years. You would give a
stranger, Mr. Clive for instance, the
impression that you were a cruel
little demon, as you sing that song.
Of course we know that only heaven<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>
in its infinite mercy lends you to us
for a little.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Mr. Clive!&#8221; said Helena in
a weary tone, but with a suspicious
alertness of eye, &#8220;I had such a
funny experience with Mr. Clive,
the other night. I think I&#8217;ll have
to tell it.&#8221; She threw back her
head and laughed infectiously:
&#8220;Oh, it was so funny!&#8221;</p>

<p>Clive experienced an uncomfortable
thrill. The others gave her immediate
attention.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t hesitate to tell us, Helena,&#8221;
said Rollins. &#8220;We will keep
your confidence. And have mercy
on our curiosity; that adjective is
so vague.&#8221;</p>

<p>Helena leaned forward, and clasping
her hand about her chin, looked
at the company with dancing eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Probably you all know,&#8221; she
said, &#8220;that not long since I spent
five hours in the forest alone with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>
Mr. Clive, talking in the midnight
hour. Well, you don&#8217;t know that
Mr. Clive had previously told me that
if he ever sat up all night with me
he should kiss me, and several times;
so when I took him to the loneliest
spot I knew, the intimation was
that I expected him to do justice to
his principles, wasn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was, Helena,&#8221; said Rollins,
with an attempt at facetiousness,
&#8220;and I hope he did. Served you
right.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, he did not! And I sat
not three feet away from him for
five hours, and never looked better.
How do you suppose I bluffed him
off?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, come Helena!&#8221; said Rollins,
who was beginning to feel
sorry for Clive.</p>

<p>&#8220;You know,&#8221; she continued,
tossing her head and tapping her
foot, much like a spirited race-horse,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
&#8220;I have always said I could do exactly
as I pleased with a man, and I
can. So it pleased me to play chess
with an Englishman, whose only
idea of the game is to jump over
the board. Well, first I mildly remonstrated
with him; then we argued
the matter, quite coolly, for
he smoked his pipe, and Englishmen
are usually cool, you know.
My powers of persuasion were not
very effective. Then I told him
that I was engaged. But as he was,
too, he could not see the force of
my remark. Well, you&#8217;d never
guess in the wide world what I did
then. I gently led him off on to
the subject of religion, and he
preached until three o&#8217;clock, and
forgot all about wanting to kiss me.
Now, I call that sort of a man a
duffer!&#8221; (with an affected drawl.)
&#8220;What do you think about it?&#8221;</p>

<p>There was an intense and uncomfortable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>
silence. Then Clive
pushed back his chair abruptly.
He walked straight up to Helena,
lifted her from her seat, pinioned
her arms, and kissed her while one
could count thirty.</p>

<p>The men sprang to their feet.
Their sympathies were with Clive,
but she was their guest, and a
woman; they would do whatever
she commanded.</p>

<p>Clive dropped her into her chair,
not too gently.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sit down, gentlemen,&#8221; she said
serenely; &#8220;we will now go on with
the dinner.&#8221;</p>

</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Van Rhuys</span> returned the next
morning. Helena and several of her
guests drove over to the hotel station
to meet him. The train was not due
for some moments after their arrival.
Helena sprang from the char-&agrave;-banc
and ran up the hill to the
Gordon cottage. Clive and Mary
came out to meet her.</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t want to write you a
formal note of congratulation, Miss
Gordon,&#8221; she said, smiling charmingly.
&#8220;I hoped to see you last
night at the dinner. I am so sorry
you were not there. It was a most
interesting dinner.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So Mr. Clive told me,&#8221; said<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>
Mary innocently. &#8220;You are very
kind, dear Miss Belmont.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I want to give you a dinner.
To-morrow? I must be quick. I
hear my train. Do say yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am so sorry, thank you so
much, but papa and I are going to
San Francisco to-morrow afternoon.
He has business, and my dress-maker
wants me. After that we
are going to pay three visits in San
Mateo and Menlo Park; we hoped
to get out of them, but it seems we
can&#8217;t, and papa thinks I&#8217;d better
go.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; said Helena. &#8220;What
are you going to do with Mr.
Clive?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is the question. Of
course he will be asked too, as soon
as they know, but he hates the
thought of it. He says he will stay
in San Francisco, and run down and
see me occasionally, but I hate to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>
have him there at this time of the
year, with those winds and fogs. I
want him to stay here and be comfortable.
It is such a rest for him
after that long trip.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Miss Gordon, you are beginning
badly. You will spoil him. I
should like to marry an Englishman
just for the pleasure of bringing
him up in the way he should go.
Suppose you leave him in my
charge. I will take good care of
him, and see that he does nothing
but loaf.&#8221; She turned to Clive, who
was staring at her, his hands in his
pockets, his lips together.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come over and stay at Casa
Norte. You know all the men, and
they will love to have you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, do, Owin,&#8221; said Mary.
&#8220;They are always so jolly there, and
I shall feel much easier about you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well,&#8221; said Clive, &#8220;I will
go. Thank you.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>&#8220;I&#8217;ll send over for you in time for
dinner. Will that be right? Oh, my
train! my train! What will Mr. Van
Rhuys think of me? Good-bye,
Miss Gordon. <i>Hasta luego</i>, Mr.
Clive.&#8221;</p>

<p>She ran down the hill as a man
came forward to meet her. He
was a big well-made man with the
walk and carriage, the perfect adjustment
of clothes which distinguish
the fashionable New Yorker.
His Dutch ancestry showed vaguely
in his face, which was fair and large,
and roughly modelled; but the
clever pleasant eyes were American;
the deep lines about them betrayed
an experience of life which reclaimed
the face from any tendency
to the commonplace. He
looked the rather <i>blas&eacute;</i> man of forty,
yet full of vitality and good-nature,
and possessed of all the brains he
would ever need.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>His eyes deepened as he took
Helena&#8217;s hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;How jolly well you look,&#8221; he
said with the slight affectation of
accent peculiar to the smart New
Yorker. &#8220;I&#8217;m awfully glad to see
you again, awfully.&#8221;</p>

<p>As the char-&agrave;-banc drove off the
girls leaned out and waved their
hands to Miss Gordon and Clive,
and Van Rhuys was told of the engagement.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-looking chap,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t he?&#8221; said Helena enthusiastically.
&#8220;I sat out all night with
him, just for the pleasure of looking
at him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Van Rhuys frowned and turned
away. He had wished more than
once that Helena Belmont, doubly
fascinating as her unconventionality
made her, had been brought up in
New York. He had had more than
one spasm of premonitory horror,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>
but had reminded himself that none
knew better than she how to be
<i>grande dame</i> if she chose.</p>

<p>When they reached the house he
went to his room to clean up, then
sought Helena in her boudoir. She
was leaning over the back of a chair,
tipping it nervously.</p>

<p>&#8220;I want to say something right
away,&#8221; she said as he closed the
door. &#8220;I want you to release me&mdash;I
cannot marry you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Van Rhuys pressed his lips together
and half closed his eyes.
But he merely asked, &#8220;What is the
reason?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am going to marry Mr. Clive.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are going to do what?&#8221;
Van Rhuys&#8217; eyes opened very wide.
He understood Helena little, and
one of her enduring charms was her
quality of the unexpected. &#8220;Are
you speaking of the man who is engaged
to Miss Gordon?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>&#8220;Yes, that is the man. I am not
joking.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You mean that you are going to
try to cut that poor girl out?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I mean that I shall,&#8221; said Helena
passionately. &#8220;He is the only man
that I have ever really wanted, and
I intend to have him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a damned dishonorable
thing to do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t care. Honor&#8217;s nothing
but an arbitrary thing, anyhow. I&#8217;ll
have what I want. It wasn&#8217;t necessary
for me to tell you this, but it
does me good to say it to somebody.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And you don&#8217;t care whether I
am hurt or not&mdash;nor that poor girl?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t believe I do. I wish
I did. I feel so wicked&mdash;but I can&#8217;t.
I can&#8217;t care for anything else. You
didn&#8217;t love me very much, anyhow.
You are merely in love with me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You never gave me the chance.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>
I have barely kissed you. I had
hoped that after a while, after we
were married, it might be different.
You have fully made up your
mind?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All the mind I&#8217;ve got is in it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I don&#8217;t see that there&#8217;s
anything for me to do but go. I
can&#8217;t hang round here. I&#8217;ll have a
sudden telegram calling me to New
York. Will you shake hands?&#8221;</p>

<p>She came forward and gave him
her hand. &#8220;Have I been unfair?&#8221;
she asked, smiling. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t have
time to write, and at least I didn&#8217;t
break it off by telephone, as I did
with one of them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have behaved with the utmost
consideration,&#8221; said Van
Rhuys dryly. He looked at her a
moment. &#8220;Suppose you fail?&#8221; he
asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Fail?&#8221; she said haughtily. &#8220;I
never fail. There&#8217;s nothing I&#8217;ll stop<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>
at&mdash;nothing! nothing! I always get
what I want. I was born that way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know; but there is a pretty
tough sort of fibre in some Englishmen,
and they call it honor. Well,
good luck to you. And good-bye;
I shall go on the 4.10.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XI.</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Clive</span> drove over the next afternoon.
He sat some distance from
Helena at dinner, and afterward she
and Mrs. Lent played billiards with
himself and one of the other men for
an hour; the rest of the evening was
passed in the large living-room,
where Clive listened to better amateur
music than he had ever heard
before. Some little time after the
women had retired, a Chinese servant
entered the dining-room, where
the men were drinking brandy-and-soda,
and said to Clive&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Missee Hellee wantee slee you in
bludoir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What?&#8221; asked Clive stupidly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Her gracious Majesty is pleased<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>
to signify that she will give you audience
in her boudoir,&#8221; said Rollins,
who stood beside him.</p>

<p>&#8220;But I can&#8217;t go to her room at this
hour. It&#8217;s one o&#8217;clock.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is her affair. Besides, no
one else need know. Follow the
Mongolian. If you don&#8217;t it&#8217;s like
her to come here and order you to
go.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Chinaman left Clive at the
door of the boudoir. The room was
empty and dimly lit. The air was
heavy with the scent of the roses
beyond the window. Clive looked
up into the forest. The aisles were
too black for shadows, although the
huge trunks were defined. The mysterious
arbors above sang gently.</p>

<p>Helena came out of her bedroom
presently, closing the door behind
her.</p>

<p>Clive went to meet her. &#8220;Am I
to apologize?&#8221; he asked. &#8220;I shan&#8217;t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>
mean it if I do. What you did was
abominable.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t scold me. I never thought
I&#8217;d do such a thing. I don&#8217;t know
what possessed me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The devil, I should say. But I
hope I&#8217;ll never see you in that mood
again. You were at your unloveliest.
You came near to being vulgar.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I was quite vulgar and you know
it. Don&#8217;t let us say any more about
it. Sit down here in the window.&#8221;</p>

<p>The window-seat was broad and
deep and heavily cushioned. They
made themselves very comfortable.</p>

<p>&#8220;You can light your pipe. I am
glad you came&mdash;very glad.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I ought not to be here at all. I
was an ungrateful wretch in the first
place not to go where I ought to be
now, and a weaker one to come
here.&#8221;</p>

<p>Helena leaned her elbow on the
low grating and looked up at him.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>
There was neither childishness nor
coquetry in her eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;But I am glad.&#8221; She paused a
moment. &#8220;I have sent away Mr.
Van Rhuys.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Van Rhuys has had a happy
escape&mdash;and I am not necessarily
uncomplimentary to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why didn&#8217;t you tell me of your
engagement to Mary Gordon the
other night?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Partly because she asked me
not to, partly because I didn&#8217;t think
it would interest you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are very modest.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Would it have interested you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It does&mdash;immensely. What an
irrepressible flirt you are!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you expect me to sit up at
midnight with a pretty woman, and
not flirt with her? Why else did
you send for me to come here?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are engaged to another
woman.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>&#8220;You expect no man to remember
his obligations when he is with you.&#8221;
He laid down his pipe suddenly.
&#8220;Give me these two weeks,&#8221; he
said; &#8220;I shall never meet a woman
like you again. If you will forget
what the end must be, I will.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why is it that Englishmen are
always marrying that type of woman&mdash;and
always forgetting their obligations?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Because it is the best type of
woman alive and the hope of the
race. Man is both the victim of
his race and of his sex. Woman is
only the victim of man&mdash;which simplifies
the question for her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you love Mary Gordon?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes&mdash;very much indeed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Shall you always love her?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think so&mdash;more and more. A
good woman becomes a great deal
to a man. She may lack the two
things that enthrall man most, passion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>
and intellect; but she shares
his burdens and his sorrows; she
never fails him in poverty or in
trouble; her sympathy is as ready
for the small harrowings of life as
for its disasters. She satisfies the
domestic instinct which is in every
man&mdash;symbolizes home to him.
She bears his children and gives
him unfailing submission and help.&#8221;</p>

<p>Helena pressed her fan against
her lips. Something stabbed
through her.</p>

<p>&#8220;A clever woman could give you
all that&mdash;and more,&#8221; she said, after
a moment.</p>

<p>&#8220;No; she might think she could
in the first enthusiasm of love. But
she would not, for the reason that
she would exact as much in return;
and a man has so little time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And is that your idea of happiness?&#8221;</p>

<p>He hesitated a moment. &#8220;It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>
would be hard to find a better.
There are plenty of clever and attractive
women a man can always
meet.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is not what I asked you.
You answered for the race, not for
yourself. Are you afraid of being
disloyal to Mary Gordon? Well,
these two weeks are to be mine, not
hers. If you will not be frank with
me how are we to know each other?
And I will keep your confidences.
Tell me&mdash;is that your idea of happiness?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It is not.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why did you ask her to marry
you&mdash;seeing things as clearly as you
do? There is not the same excuse
for you as for many men.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Four years ago I had thought
less. And propinquity is a strong
factor.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What shall you do when you
meet the one woman?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know. No man knows
beforehand what he will do in any
circumstance. Perhaps I should
behave like a scoundrel and cut.
Perhaps I should find strength somewhere.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What is the use of strength?
What do all those ideals amount to,
anyhow? I have often had the
most exalted longings, a desire for
something better and higher, I
hardly know what. And I have always
asked&mdash;To what end? <i>Cui
bono?</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is because you will believe
that the mystery of your nature
means nothing; that the blind
striving of millions of beings for
spiritual things, which is formulated
under the general name of religion,
means nothing. The lower plane
you live on now the longer will be
your climb hereafter.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>&#8220;Does Mary Gordon share your
convictions?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have never spoken of them to
her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Shall you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Most likely.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And she will believe whatever
you tell her to believe?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think I can carry her with
me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And that will be another
bond?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are an extraordinary man,
and we do have the most remarkable
midnight conversations.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am ready to talk of other
things. Are you going to give me
these two weeks?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you going to behave yourself,
or are you going to treat me
to another performance like that of
last night?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>&#8220;Oh&mdash;never! I hope I shall
never feel that way again. Papa
used to encourage me when I got
on my high horse, and I always let
myself go. But I became ashamed
of myself for being so undignified,
some years ago. I can&#8217;t think why I&mdash;yes
I can, of course, and you know
why just as well as I do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Give me your hand.&#8221;</p>

<p>She gave it to him, and he bent
over her. She had no thought of
failure, but she shrank away.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>&#8220;For what? You have dismissed
Van Rhuys, and we have only two
weeks.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it necessary that I should
kiss you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you think it would be fair
to me if you did not? Do you expect
me to wander all day in that
forest and sit up all night with you
without kissing you? What do you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>
think I am made of? I might with
a woman who was intellectual and
nothing more, but not with you.&#8221;</p>

<p>She slipped away from him and
stood up, drawing her hands over
her eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;I cannot understand myself,&#8221;
she said. &#8220;I have let eight men kiss
me and thought little about it, but I
cannot kiss you whom I would
rather than any man I have ever
known. Won&#8217;t you go away now?&#8221;</p>

<p>He got up at once.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know what there is
about you,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I never
knew another woman whom I would
have obeyed for a moment in the
same conditions. Good-night.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">He</span> did not see her alone again
for two days, although he was with
her constantly, and they had long
talks apart. There were seven
clever men at Casa Norte this time;
all of the women were bright, or
more, and the days and nights were
very gay. They rode and drove
and sailed and picnicked, and sang
and played tennis and told stories,
and there was much good conversation.
Clive wrote a brief note
daily to Mary Gordon, but gave up
his thoughts recklessly to Helena
Belmont. She showed to full advantage
as hostess: thoughtful,
suggestive, womanly, unselfish.
Her mind, as revealed in their long<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>
conversations, captivated him. Her
grace appealed more keenly to his
senses than her beauty, which
sometimes, as she talked, wholly
disappeared, broken by a personality
so strong and so variable as to
play havoc with its harmonies.</p>

<p>On the third morning he met her
in the pink-and-green wilderness of
the rose-garden. The dew glittered
on every leaf and petal, for the sun
was hardly over the mountain.
The guests had been ordered early
to bed the night before, that they
might rise early and go on a picnic
in a distant part of the forest.
Rollins was buttoning his shirt before
an open window and singing a
duet with Mrs. Tower, who had her
head out of another window. Helena
wore a pink-and-white organdie
frock and a large hat lined with
pink. She was gathering a cluster
of roses for her belt. As Clive<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>
joined her she plucked a bud and
pinned it on his cheviot shirt: he
wore no coat; the men only dressed
for dinner.</p>

<p>Clive&#8217;s broad shoulders were between
the house and Helena. He
pressed his hand suddenly over hers,
flattening the bud.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve stuck me,&#8221; she said,
pouting. &#8220;These roses are full of
thorns.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think I&#8217;d better go.&#8221;</p>

<p>She gave him a glance of mingled
alarm, anger and appeal.</p>

<p>&#8220;You will not go!&#8221;</p>

<p>She turned her hand about and
clasped it over his.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is the use? I&#8217;m afraid
I&#8217;m getting in too deep. What
common sense I have left tells me
to get out while there is time.&#8221;</p>

<p>She tightened her clasp. &#8220;But
you won&#8217;t go?&#8221; she said imperiously.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>&#8220;No, I shall not go. If I did I
shouldn&#8217;t stay.&#8221;</p>

<p>Helena threw back her head, her
woman&#8217;s keen delight in power over
man as strong for the moment as
her gladness in Clive&#8217;s touch and
presence.</p>

<p>After breakfast Miss Belmont
and her guests drove for two hours
through the forest, scarcely seeing
the sun, then camped in a ca&ntilde;on by
a running stream. The ca&ntilde;on was
narrow at the bottom but widened
above, and seemed to have gathered
all the sunshine of the day.
Its sides were a tangle of fragrant
chaparral, wild roses, purple lilac,
and red lily, the delicate green of
young trees, the metallic green and
red of the madro&ntilde;o. On high were
the stark redwoods.</p>

<p>Some of the men went frankly to
sleep after luncheon. The others<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>
and several of the girls fished ardently.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come,&#8221; said Helena to Clive,
&#8220;there is a trail over there, and I
want to see what is on top.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It will be a hard pull.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you want to come? Very
well, I&#8217;ll go alone. Hang my hat
on that tree.&#8221;</p>

<p>She sprang lightly from stone to
stone across the stream.</p>

<p>He followed her up the steep
side of the ca&ntilde;on, through brush so
dense that they were quickly out of
sight, and through a bewildering
fragrance. At the top they were in
the dark forest again, and pushed
along as best they could. They
found themselves among the straggling
outposts of an under-forest of
fronds. A few redwoods spread
their spiked arms above it, but the
sun touched many a rustling fan.
The heights beyond lifted away irregularly,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>
in steeps and galleries
and higher levels, a gracious blue
mist softening the austerity of the
crowding trees. A creek roared
softly above the low rhythmic murmur
of the forest. Even these
slight sounds seemed to intrude on
the great primeval silence.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; asked Helena, &#8220;the
peculiar influence of these redwood
forests? I have been in other forests
in many parts of the world,
and I have never known anything
like this. It lifts one up, makes
one feel capable of anything, and
yet gives one a terrible longing and
loneliness&mdash;when one is alone.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is partly spiritual, partly sensual.
The forest seems to hold in
essence the two principles of the
universe. Do you want to go in
among these ferns? They are
pretty thick, but I can hold them
back for you.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>&#8220;Yes, I want to see what is in
there.&#8221;</p>

<p>They pushed in among the fronds,
which grew taller as they penetrated.
Soon Clive had no need to
hold the leaves apart for his companion;
they spread out a foot and
more above their heads. The
place, a young forest of slender columns,
was filled with green light.
Small feathery ferns nodded in a
little breeze. The creek seemed to
murmur above them. Clive turned
and looked at Helena. Her face
was glorified. He took her in his
arms and kissed her. She did not
shrink from him, and they clung
together.</p>

<p>After a few moments she moved
her head back and looked up at
him. His eyes were not laughing.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is something I want to
say,&#8221; she said. &#8220;A woman doesn&#8217;t
usually say it until she is asked. I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>
love you. I want you to know that
I couldn&#8217;t kiss you like that if I did
not.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I believe that you love me,&#8221; he
said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you guess the reason I did
not kiss you the other night? I had
intended to, but it suddenly came to
me that you did not love me enough,
that you were merely in love with
me; and I could not give myself
like that. I intended to wait longer
than this. But I forgot.&#8221; She hesitated
a moment&mdash;the color left her
face. &#8220;Do you love me?&#8221; she
asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I love you.&#8221;</p>

<p>She went back to his arms, but
even while she learned the lesson
that some women learn once only,
and then possessingly and finally,
she realized that she had not the
courage to speak of Mary Gordon.
She had intended, the moment she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>
was sure of him, to command him to
break his engagement at once; but
her arrogant will found itself supple
before the strong fibre of the
man, and shrank from the encounter.
They walked on after a
time, until they came to a stone,
where they sat down. She put her
hands about his face. The motion
was a little awkward, but she was a
woman who would grow very lavish
with caresses.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why do you look so serious?&#8221;
she asked. &#8220;You looked so different
a moment ago.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The situation is serious,&#8221; he
said briefly. &#8220;But don&#8217;t let us talk
about it; we have twelve more
days.&#8221;</p>

<p>She threw her head back against
his shoulder and looked up into the
feathery roof. A ray of light wandered
in and touched her face. &#8220;I
am so happy,&#8221; she said, &#8220;I don&#8217;t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>
care what to-morrow brings. I
have thought and thought of being
with you like this and now I am
and it is enough. I ought to be serious&mdash;I
know what you are thinking
of&mdash;but it doesn&#8217;t matter; nothing
but this matters. I never took
life seriously&mdash;except in a sort of
abstract mental way occasionally&mdash;until
a week ago, and I doubt if I
could keep it up.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You could keep it up. You
don&#8217;t know yourself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Once I got dreadfully bored
and took care of a sick poor woman
who lived in a cabin near a place
where I was staying. Her husband
was away in the mines, and she had
no one to look after her but neighbors
as poor as herself. I sat up
with her and worked over her as if
she were my sister. I was frightfully
interested, and so proud of
myself. Then one morning&mdash;I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>
think it was the fifth&mdash;I was sitting
by the window about four o&#8217;clock,
looking at the view, which was
beautiful&mdash;a rolling country covered
with closely trimmed grape-vines,
and miles and miles beyond
a range of blue mountains. It was
so quiet. Eternity must be like
that quiet of four in the morning.
And gradually as I looked, the most
sickening disgust crept over me for
the life I had led the past four days,
an utter collapse of my philanthropy.
I wanted to go away and be frivolous.
I was hideously bored. I
hated the sick woman, her poverty
and everything serious in life. I
stole away and sent back a servant
to stop until I could get a trained
nurse. I never went near the
woman again.&#8221;</p>

<p>He pressed her to him with passionate
sympathy. &#8220;Poor child,&#8221;
he said, &#8220;you have lived only in
the shallows. I wish you always
might.&#8221;</p>

<p>But she was too happy to heed
anything but the strength of his
embrace.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>&#8220;You don&#8217;t know yourself,&#8221; he
said, &#8220;not the least little bit.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know a lot more than you think,
and I know how I can love you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You hardly know that. You
have merely a vague far away notion.
All your woman&#8217;s lore is borrowed,
and you are only half awake. Your
mind, your mental conception of
things, has outrun everything else.
If the other part ever caught up
you would be a wonderful woman.&#8221;</p>

<p>Something in his tone made her
take her will between her teeth.</p>

<p>&#8220;You will teach me,&#8221; she said
imperiously, &#8220;as long as we are both
alive.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, if I am a scoundrel. But
don&#8217;t let us talk about that now,
please. I will be happy, too. Come,
let us get out of this. It is damp
and we will get rheumatism, which is
not romantic. Let us go home and
sit in your boudoir. I feel as if I
should like to be surrounded by the
conventionalities of life for a time.
One feels too primitive in this forest.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> next morning she awoke with
a sudden pang of sympathy for
Mary Gordon. Her intuitions were
keener than they had ever been.
She turned restlessly, then sprang
out of bed and rang for her maid.</p>

<p>She went out into the garden and
gathered a basket of roses for the
breakfast-table. As she entered the
court, the dew on her hair, her damp
frock clinging to her bust and arms,
Clive was standing by the fountain,
and alone. His eyes had been dull,
but the light sprang to them as he
went forward to meet her. He half
held out his arms. She dropped the
basket into them with a little laugh.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come into the dining-room,&#8221;
she said, &#8220;and help me arrange
them.&#8221;</p>

<p>The water was ready in the silver
and crystal bowls. She disposed
the roses with a few practised<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>
touches, then turned and flung her
arms about Clive and kissed him.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is the matter,&#8221; she asked.
&#8220;Didn&#8217;t you sleep?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No; not much.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You said you would not think.
Not for twelve days.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall try not to.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You must sleep after breakfast.
I&#8217;ll have your room darkened and
all the horrid flies put out, and
Faun will stand outside your door
and see that no one passes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What a dear little wife you
would make.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you think I would make a
good wife?&#8221; she asked anxiously.
&#8220;That you could do anything with
all this raw material?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think you would make the
most perfect wife in the world,&#8221; he
said.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Helena made no secret of her love
for Clive. Even if she had been less
sure of success, she would have
gloried in doing him honor. But,
although she did not doubt the issue,
she had respect enough for him to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>
scent a battle ahead, and the savage
in her was ardent for the fight.</p>

<p>The household was profoundly
interested. Helena, despite her love
of power, had never been known before
to deliberately woo a man from
another woman. They knew that
she must be mastered by a passion
new to her, to ignore a girl whom
she liked and respected as she did
Mary Gordon. Even the women
believed she would win; only Rollins
doubted.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; he said to Mrs.
Lent; &#8220;he&#8217;s broad-guage, that man.
He&#8217;s so infatuated now that he
doesn&#8217;t know where he&#8217;s at. But
he&#8217;ll wake up, and then I don&#8217;t know
that even Helena Belmont will be
able to manage him. A man hates
to go back on a girl, anyhow; he
doesn&#8217;t exactly know how to do it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I wish he&#8217;d hurry and
make up his mind,&#8221; said Mrs. Lent,
&#8220;for he looks like a funeral. He
flirted with even poor little me when
he first came, but I haven&#8217;t seen that
delightfully wicked expression in his
eyes for a week.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIV.</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Clive</span> would not sit up all night
with Helena, but they spent hours
of the day in the forest, and there
was nothing funereal in his aspect
when they were alone. One morning
Helena&#8217;s maid brought her a
note when she came to awaken her.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;My dear Miss Belmont&#8221; (it ran),&mdash;&#8220;I
am going away for a few days. I shall be
back on Monday, at four.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="indentright">&#8220;Yours truly,</span><br />
&#8220;<span class="smcap">Owin Clive</span>.&#8221;</p>
</div>

<p>Helena stared at the abrupt, formal
missive in dismay for a moment;
then laughed. She had seen men
struggle in her net before. She
knew that he would keep his word
and return, and had perfect faith in
the power of her seductive charm, no
matter what good resolve he might
accomplish when away.</p>

<p>It was a hot day, and her guests
were too indolent to do anything<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>
but lie about and smoke and read.
They did not want to be entertained,
and she let them alone and spent
the day in the rose-garden in the
shade of the oaks. She rather enjoyed
thinking of Clive, for variety,
and anticipating his return. She
concocted clever arguments and
convincing appeals. She saw herself
in the gowns she would wear
when he was with her again, and
was glad for the wealth that gave
such potent aid to her beauty. She
was very happy: the future was so
exquisite that she trembled and
grew breathless at the thought of it.</p>

<p>The next day she sat on a ledge
below the crest of the cliffs, and
stared at the huge restless waves of
the Pacific rearing against the outlying
rocks, falling with their baffled
roar. There was neither peace, nor
reason, nor power of anticipation in
her. She was insensible of any instinct
beyond an insufferable desire
for his physical presence.</p>

<p>That night she went to bed glad
with the thought that she should see
him in sixteen hours, and pictured<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>
their meeting so often and variously,
and struck a match to look at the
clock so many times, that she slept
little. The next morning she was
so nervous and apprehensive that
the placid conversation of her guests
was intolerable, and she would not
drive with them. After luncheon
she went up to a favorite spot in the
forest, directing one of the Chinese
servants to conduct Clive to her
when he returned.</p>

<p>As the afternoon wore on her
gloom lifted and passed. She grew
light minded and humorous, almost
indifferent. She took herself to
task in some dismay: in the fitness
of things she should be passionately
serious when he arrived. &#8220;Are
there really no great crises in life?&#8221;
she thought. &#8220;Are we all comedians
gone wrong, personified
jokes?&#8221; But she was helpless;
the reaction was inevitable.</p>

<p>Clive was late. He was always
late. Helena felt no uneasiness,
but sat idly, wondering how they
would meet, her mind occasionally
drifting to other things. She had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>
carried a large hat lined with white
and covered with white plumes, in
a box through the damaging brush,
and hidden the box in a hollow redwood.
The hat, pushed backward
on her brilliant hair, enhanced the
oval colorous beauty of her face.
She took it off suddenly and threw
it on the ground; the attempt was
too evident; all men were not consistently
dense.</p>

<p>She heard a crackling in the brush
on the other side of the creek, then
the Chinaman&#8217;s protesting voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t hully when catchee pigtail
allee time, Mister Clive. Me got
thlee velly bad sclatches, and
clothes allee same no washee.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was no answer from Clive,
but he was in view presently. The
Chinaman retreated hastily, wrapping
his pigtail round his neck.
Helena rose and went forward.
She felt suddenly resentful and
haughty.</p>

<p>After all, it was presumption in a
man to take upon himself the deciding
of a question which was as vital
to her as to him. She wondered if<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>
she really did love him; certainly
she felt neither tenderness nor tolerance
at the moment.</p>

<p>Clive walked slowly across the
felled redwood which served as
bridge between the high banks of
the creek. As he approached Helena
forgot herself and her moods.</p>

<p>&#8220;He has suffered horribly,&#8221; she
thought. &#8220;What am I that I did not
know he must?&#8221;</p>

<p>And then she realized that she
could not comprehend his experience
of the past three days; that her mind
merely grasped the fact; she had
no profounder, more sympathetic
understanding. She drew back,
frightened and chilled.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am sorry to see you looking so
badly,&#8221; she said coldly, as they
shook hands. &#8220;Perhaps we had
better have it out at once.&#8221;</p>

<p>They sat down against two redwoods,
facing each other.</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well,&#8221; said Clive, &#8220;I have
been a scoundrel and nothing I can
say is the least excuse. I can only
state the facts.... The average
girl who is an avowed flirt expects to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>
be made love to, and a man finds it
no task to do what a charming woman
exacts of him.... I took you
in the beginning for a spoilt beauty,
a coquette, above the average as far
as brain was concerned, but still
suggesting little more than an
unusually spirited flirtation. Of
course, I was far more fascinated
than I realized or I should not have
come to your house, nor should I
have asked you to give me these two
weeks.... That it might mean life or
death to either of us I did not realize
until that day among the ferns.&#8221;</p>

<p>The fight was on. Helena threw
back her head. &#8220;Can you not explain
to Mary Gordon? Surely she
would release you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I never could explain to Mary
Gordon. She would comprehend
that after four years I had thrown
her over for a prettier woman whom
I had known two weeks. Women
like that&mdash;simple, good, loyal women&mdash;don&#8217;t
reason and analyze as
a clever woman does. And the
hurt lasts&mdash;not because the man is
worth it, any more than any man is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>
good enough for such women&mdash;but
because they are what they are.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But she was not the woman for
you; therefore she would find another
man.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She would live on an isolated
ranch in Southern California for
several years, then go back to England
and live in her old home,
among the people she has known
all her life. Those women don&#8217;t
seek distraction. They are the
slaves of an idea. If the right man
did come she wouldn&#8217;t know it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All of which means that you
think it your duty to marry her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I mean to marry her. There is
nothing else to be done. If there
were no other reason I have no
right to make her ridiculous.&#8221;</p>

<p>Helena caught her breath. For the
first time she mentally appreciated
the strength in the man which had
captivated her woman&#8217;s instincts.
But she did not lose courage.</p>

<p>&#8220;And I am not to be considered
at all? I say nothing about being
made ridiculous. If I am it is my
own fault, and I don&#8217;t care, anyhow;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>
that seems to me a very insignificant
matter. Now that I
have found you am I to be left
alone&mdash;thirty, forty years? You
know that I have about equal possibilities
of good and bad in me. If
I married you I could become as
wholly good as any mortal can. I
never realized what possibilities
there are in any of us as I did in
the last few days before you went
away. The principal reason that I
love you is because I always feel that
there is something in you to climb
to and that you could lift me up to
you. If you leave me I&#8217;ll become a
bad woman. Why not? It must be
very interesting, and I have nothing
more in life to look forward to. If
I lived with you I might grow into
your belief; you could carry me anywhere;
but alone I cannot. Moreover,
I want to live in this life. I cannot
sit down and wait patiently for a
mythical and unsubstantial hereafter.
I am too much of a savage, I
suppose, but at all events, I can&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There will be no excuse for you
to become a bad woman. You have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>
too much brain and money&mdash;too
many methods of distraction. You
can travel and make any life you
choose. The world is an interesting
place; you don&#8217;t know the A B C
of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are cruel.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he said. &#8220;More so than
you realize just now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not doubting that you love
me. If I did do you suppose I
would argue with you? I&#8217;m not in
a tender or sympathetic mood.
There is too much to be said. I
<i>must</i> talk it out now; we are not an
ordinary pair of fools.&#8221; She paused
a moment and looked straight at
him. &#8220;We have a more imperative
duty to ourselves than to traditions.
You are in the new world now, almost
in a new civilization. Smash
such outworn ideals. They are nothing,
nothing to human happiness.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Such traditions as honor and
faith and pity for the weaker are in
the bone and blood of the older civilization.
If we tore them out there
is not much we&#8217;ve got that&#8217;s worth
anything that wouldn&#8217;t follow.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>&#8220;I would not care&mdash;not a straw.
I should love you whether you were
satisfied with yourself or not, and I
could make you forget.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No; you could not.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, you are way above me,&#8221; she
said bitterly. &#8220;I don&#8217;t mean to say
that I haven&#8217;t known plenty of honorable
men, but they would find a
way out of it&mdash;for me. You seem
to be welded together so compactly
that every characteristic is bound
up with every other. Nothing is
acquired, separate. Probably I&#8217;d
never reach you, after all. Perhaps
it is as well we don&#8217;t marry&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish you would not talk as if I
were an infernal prig. Can&#8217;t you
imagine what an ass a man feels
when a woman rots to him like that?
I am the most ordinary person you
will probably ever know. If I
were not we wouldn&#8217;t be where we
are to-day. Now that I have made
such a mess of things I can only see
one way out of it, and I don&#8217;t feel a
hero, I assure you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you thought of yourself at
all during the last three days?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course I&#8217;ve thought of myself.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>
What a question. And thinking
of myself meant thinking of you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you have thought more of
Mary Gordon&mdash;I mean you have
considered her more.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; I have.&#8221;</p>

<p>She got up and went over and
sat down on the edge of the bluff.
He filled his pipe. She smiled as
the smoke drifted to her. She
thought that she had never seen the
creek look so beautiful. The stones
under the clear water shone like
opaque jewels. Great bunches of
feathery maiden-hair clung to every
boulder. The long delicate strands
of the ice-grass trailed far over
the water. Tiny trees sprouted
from rocks in mid-stream, where
moss had gathered. Red lilies and
ferns grew close to the brink. The
ugly brown roots of a pine clung,
squirming, down the bluff.</p>

<p>On the mountain above the plateau
a deer leaped once, crashing
through the brush, tossing his white
horns in terror at sight of man. A
squirrel chattered high up in a redwood,
where he was packing acorns
for the winter. A school of salmon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>
swam serenely down the creek and
disappeared in the dark perspective.</p>

<p>Helena sat there for a half-hour.
Then she went back to Clive, but
did not sit down. He rose also.</p>

<p>&#8220;I understand you a little better,
I think,&#8221; she said. &#8220;You won&#8217;t
like what I am going to say, but I
shall say it, anyhow. You have so
much good in you. I never thought
I should love a good man, but I believe
that is really the reason I love
you so much. The raw material in
me responds to the highly developed
in you. You are capable of so
much that is way beyond me. I
have fine impulses, but they are
shallow; lofty ideals, but in a little
while they bore me. And you are
consistent. Even when you do
what you know to be wrong, you
never vary in your ideals and faith.
I am new and crude and heterogeneous.
It is the difference between
the Old and the New.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have the richest possibilities
of any woman I have ever
known&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell me something. Is it not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>
because Mary Gordon is the more
helpless and appeals more to your
chivalry?&mdash;although you love me
more; although I have more beauty
and brains and passion, and could
make you far happier?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is one reason.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then will the manliest and best
of men continue to be captured by
the best and simplest of women?
It will produce a better race, I suppose.
If I had been your mother
you would not be half what you are.
It is enough for the man to have
the brain, I suppose. We are a
forced growth and abnormal&mdash;but
what is to become of us?&#8221;</p>

<p>His reserve left him then and he
caught her in his arms. She clung
to him desperately, and for a while
forgot that the victory was still to be
won. Then she cried, and coaxed,
and pleaded, and lavished endearment,
and was far more difficult for
the man to combat than when he had
stood his ground with a brain alone.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come,&#8221; he said finally; &#8220;can&#8217;t
you understand? You might help
me a little. Can&#8217;t you see that I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>
want to let everything go and stay
with you? Don&#8217;t you think I know
what I should find with you? You
do know that? Well, then, you
should also know that I have made
up my mind to do the only decent
thing a man could do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, give me a month longer.
Let me have that much, at least.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall go to-morrow. If I go
now all these people will quickly
forget me, and regard what has
passed between us as one of your
flirtations. But if I stayed on I
should make you ridiculous, and
perhaps compromise you&mdash;you are
so reckless. And for other reasons
the sooner I get away from here
the better.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What are the other reasons?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve discussed the subject
enough. Come, let us go.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I never knew that a man could
be so obstinate with a beautiful
woman he loved.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have a woman&#8217;s general
knowledge of men, but you know
nothing of any type you haven&#8217;t encountered.
I believe you could make<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>
any man love you; but certain men
are greater cowards before certain
inherited principles than they are
before the prospect of parting from
the woman they most love&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I said that you were the victim
of traditions.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps I am, but I am also unable
to eat raw fish or human flesh.
What are any of us but the logical
results of traditions? Just look at
this fog. Let me put your shawl
round you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Helena turned. A fine white
mist was pouring out of the forest
on the other side of the creek. It
had passed them, and was puffing
slowly onward. It lay softly on the
creek, covering the bright water.
It swirled about the trees and
moved lightly through the dark arbors
above. It fled up the mountain
beyond, and the forest showed
through the silver veil like grey columns
with capitals and bases of
frozen spray.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, we must go,&#8221; said Helena,
&#8220;or we shall be lost.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XV.</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Helena</span> did not meet her guests
at dinner that night, nor did she
trouble to send word that she
was ill. She rang for the Chinese
butler, gave him an order, then
locked her doors and sat motionless
in her boudoir for hours. She pictured
until her brain ached and her
ears rang what her life with Clive
could have been, and what his would
be with Mary Gordon.</p>

<p>But despair was not in her as yet,
for he was still under the same roof,
and she had not played her last card.
It was a card that she had half-consciously
considered from the beginning,
and during the last few days
had looked full upon. To-night for
the first time she realized that it was
a hateful card, unworthy of her, but
reminded herself that she was a woman
who would, if necessary, walk<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>
straight to her purpose over cracking
and spouting earth.</p>

<p>At twelve o&#8217;clock she sat before
her dressing-table regarding herself
attentively in the mirror. She wore
a neglig&eacute; of white cr&ecirc;pe and lace,
which half revealed her neck and
bust. Her unbound hair clung to
her body like melted copper, which
had just begun to stiffen into rings,
and waves, and spirals. She had
never looked more beautiful.</p>

<p>There was a knock at her door.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; she asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Allee gentlemens go to bled,&#8221;
announced Ah Sing cautiously.</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well.&#8221;</p>

<p>She rose hurriedly, almost over-turning
her chair. Her hands shook.
She caught sight of a terrified face
in the mirror.</p>

<p>&#8220;This won&#8217;t do!&#8221; she thought
angrily. She rang. Ah Sing returned.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bring me a glass of champagne,&#8221;
she said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Allight.&#8221;</p>

<p>She closed the door upon him,
then opened it quickly. &#8220;Ah Sing!&#8221;
she called.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>The Chinaman returned.</p>

<p>&#8220;Light a lamp in the drawing-room
and ask Mr. Clive to go there.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Allight.&#8221;</p>

<p>She stood leaning against the door,
her hand pressed hard against her
chin, her eyes staring angrily at her
reflection in a long Psyche mirror.</p>

<p>Ah Sing tapped and handed in the
champagne. She pushed it aside
with a gesture of disgust.</p>

<p>&#8220;Take it away. Did you do as I
told you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, missee, Mr. Clive in dlawing-loom
now.&#8221;</p>

<p>He went out, and still Helena
stared at herself in the mirror with
angry terrified eyes. After all, she
was but a girl with a woman&#8217;s theories.
What she was determined
upon had seemed very easy and
picturesque at long range. She had
even rehearsed it mentally during
the past two days; but now that
she was to enact the <i>r&ocirc;le</i> it appalled
her. She recalled several scenes of
the sort as presented by the makers
of fiction (the canny and imaginative
Frenchmen for the most part), but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>
failed to find spiritual stamina in the
retrospect.</p>

<p>&#8220;What a fool! What a fool!&#8221;
she thought. &#8220;I, who have prided
myself that I have a will of iron. If
his first duty is to me he will stay,
and two people will be happy instead
of miserable. As for Mary Gordon
she will marry the curate inside of
five years.&#8221;</p>

<p>She retreated suddenly to her
wardrobe, and wrapped a broad
scarf about her shoulders and bust,
then brought her foot down and
went resolutely out into the corridor.</p>

<p>The fog was banked in the court.
The palms looked like the dissolving
eidola of themselves. The invisible
fountain splashed heavily, as
if oppressed.</p>

<p>&#8220;I needed the shawl, after all,&#8221;
she thought grimly. &#8220;A sneeze
might be fatal.&#8221;</p>

<p>She walked rapidly down the corridor
to the drawing-room, and without
giving herself an instant for
vacillation, turned the knob and went
in. Then she cowered against the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>
door and would have exchanged
every hope she possessed for the
privilege of retreat. But Clive had
seen her.</p>

<p>He was standing by the mantel.
He looked his best, as he always did
in evening dress. Even as Helena
wondered if the earth were quaking
beneath Casa Norte, she was conscious
of his remarkable physical
beauty. He had his pipe in his hand.
It dropped suddenly to the mantel-shelf.
But he did not go forward to
meet her.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is something I want to
say,&#8221; she gasped, searching wildly for
inspiration. &#8220;It has occurred to me
that perhaps the reason you hesitated
was my money. I will give it
all away&mdash;to charity or my aunt. I
will only keep a little, so as not to be
a burden to you. You may think
this a silly, Quixotic idea&mdash;made on
the impulse of the moment&mdash;but indeed
I would.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am sure that you would. I
had not thought of the money. I
did not get that far.&#8221;</p>

<p>Helena pressed her hands against<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>
the door behind her. She felt an
impulse to laugh hysterically. For
the life of her she could not remember
a detail that she had rehearsed.
She felt as if on the edge of a farce-comedy.
But she would not give up
the game.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am so tired,&#8221; she said plaintively.
&#8220;I have eaten nothing since
I saw you, and I have thought and
thought and thought until I am all
worn out.&#8221;</p>

<p>He placed a chair at once.</p>

<p>&#8220;You poor little thing,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;Let me go to the larder and see if
I can&#8217;t find you something&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No; I don&#8217;t want anything.&#8221;</p>

<p>She sat down, holding the shawl
closely about her. Clive returned to
the mantel.</p>

<p>&#8220;My head ached so I had to take
my hair down,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wonder what is going on in
your head at the present moment.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you know?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No. Why are you such a reckless
child? You could have seen
me in the morning.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I came here to make it impossible<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>
for you to marry Mary Gordon.
I can&#8217;t do it, and I feel like a
fool.&#8221;</p>

<p>He turned away his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;I told you before that the <i>r&ocirc;le</i> of
Delilah did not suit you. And if it
did, couldn&#8217;t you see that I had
made up my mind? What sort of a
weakling&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You didn&#8217;t let me finish,&#8221; she
interrupted him, blushing furiously.
&#8220;I meant&mdash;of course I meant&mdash;that
I want you to leave with me for Europe
to-morrow&mdash;we can marry in
San Francisco&mdash;I must look like a
Delilah! Why do the novelists and
dramatists arrange these matters so
much better than we do?&mdash;Oh,
what an idiot I am, anyhow!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Go back to your room&mdash;please
do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You won&#8217;t marry me to-morrow,
then?&mdash;good heavens! that I should
propose to a man!&#8221;</p>

<p>He made no reply.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe you love me a
bit.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course you don&#8217;t. A woman
never gives a man credit for any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span>
decency of motive: her theory is
that he follows along the line of
least resistance. Well, I suppose
he does.&#8221;</p>

<p>She dropped her face into her
hands.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, what shall I do? What
shall I do?&#8221; she said passionately.</p>

<p>Clive brought his hand close
above his own eyes. &#8220;Will it not
help you to know that I love you
unalterably?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Can a man remember a woman
like that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is one woman in every
man&#8217;s life that he never forgets;
and that woman, worse luck, is
rarely his wife.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It would mean everything to
me. And I could be true to you.
But it doesn&#8217;t satisfy me.&#8221; She
dropped her hands and stared at
him. &#8220;I want you&mdash;<i>you</i>. How am
I to drag out my life? I can&#8217;t believe
that after to-night I shall
never see you again. I can&#8217;t! I
can&#8217;t!&#8221; She stood up and leaned
against the opposite end of the mantel.
&#8220;Do you know one thing that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>
keeps on hurting me through everything?&#8221;
she asked after a few moments.
&#8220;It is that you suffer more
than I do, than I am capable of suffering,
and that I cannot sympathize
with you as I want to do. Is that
the reason that you don&#8217;t love me
well enough to give up everything
else for me&mdash;that I am not strong
enough to hold you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course it is not the reason.
If you really love me&mdash;and I believe
you do&mdash;you will suffer enough
before you get through.&#8221;</p>

<p>For a while neither spoke again,
nor moved. The ocean sounded as
if it were under the window.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is another thing,&#8221; she
said, finally. &#8220;I may as well say it.
I know that if I had succeeded to-night
I should have been horribly
disappointed in you. It wouldn&#8217;t
be you any longer. For what I love
in you is your strength&mdash;a strength
I don&#8217;t possess. I&#8217;m glad I came
to-night, although I&#8217;ve made myself
ridiculous; I know both you and
myself better. I can be true to you
now; I don&#8217;t think I could have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>
been before, and I might have done
reckless things. And perhaps after
you have gone and the novelty and
excitement have worn off, I shall
understand you still better. That is
what I shall live for. Promise me
that you will believe that, and that
spiritually I shall never be far from
you, and that I am growing better
instead of worse.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t need to promise.&#8221; His
left hand was still above his eyes.
Helena saw his right clench. She
went toward the door.</p>

<p>He went forward to open it for
her. As he reached out his hand
for the knob she struck it down and
flung her arms about him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t go like this,&#8221; she said
passionately. &#8220;You must kiss me
once more.&#8221;</p>

<p>He caught her to him. She saw
his eyes blaze as he bent his head,
and thought, as far as she was capable
of thinking, that her generalities
had been correct. Even in the
rapture of the moment a pang
shot through her. Then she found
herself on the other side of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>
door and heard the key turn in the
lock.</p>

<p>She remembered only that she
was hungry and tired. She went to
the larder, and sat on a box and ate
a plate of cold chicken and bread,
then went to bed and slept soundly.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVI.</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Next</span> morning the guests of Casa
Norte were assembled in the court
discussing Clive&#8217;s departure and
waiting for the traps which would
take them for their accustomed
drive, when Helena, dressed in her
habit, came out of her room and
walked up to them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Clive has gone, I suppose?&#8221;
she asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;He left a short time ago,&#8221; said
Miss Lord. &#8220;I am so sorry he will
not return. Helena, how can you
be so cruel?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are a hypocrite and talking
rubbish. I tried to get him away
from Mary Gordon, and I lost the
game, and I don&#8217;t care in the least
whether you know it or not. I shall
not drive with you this morning.
I am going for a ride by myself;&#8221;
and she left the house.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>&#8220;Home, heaven, and mother!&#8221;
said Rollins with a gasp. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t
think even she would be as game as
that. Well, I am sorry&mdash;sorry.
Damn the whole business of life,
anyhow.&#8221;</p>

<p>Helena rode rapidly through the
forest, taking a short cut by trail to
the fern grove above the ca&ntilde;on.
She came upon it after an hour&#8217;s
hard riding. She noted that it was
almost circular in form, irregularly
outlined by the redwoods. The
stiff and feather tops were rustling
in a soft breeze and glinted with the
younger shades of green. She
thought that she had never seen the
sky so blue, the sun so golden. The
trees were singing high above. Occasionally
one branch creaked upon
another discordantly.</p>

<p>She tethered her horse and went
in among the ferns. When they
closed above her head, and the green
twilight was about her, she felt
gratefully that she was beyond the
eye of man, hidden even from the
redwoods, which, she had a fancy,
were human and wise.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>She sat down on the stone and
cried. Tears did not come easily to
her; she was not a lightly emotional
woman. To-day she abandoned
herself to a passion of grief which
thrilled her nerves and cramped her
fingers. It was a passion which accumulated
depth and strength instead
of dissipating itself, and it was
an hour before she was exhausted.
The storm brought no relief, as April
showers do to most women. She
felt heavy and blunt, and knew that
the third stage would be the first.
She was conscious of one other thing
only: that she understood Clive
better than she had ever done before,
and that her sympathy was as strong
for him as for herself.</p>

<p>Suddenly she sprang to her feet
and faced the point of the fern-wood
where she had made entrance.
The tears dried under the rush of
blood.</p>

<p>&#8220;Owin!&#8221; she cried. &#8220;Owin!&#8221;</p>

<p>She strained her head forward,
then drew back slowly. There was
not a sound in the forest. Her lips
fell apart. &#8220;Owin!&#8221; she gasped.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>
She shook from head to foot. He
had a quick strong step. She
heard it now with a sub-consciousness
of which she had never been
cognizant before. But it made no
sound in her ears.</p>

<p>Then she sank back against the
ferns, bending them with her
weight, closing her eyes. The spiritual
part within her seemed to
become clearly defined. Something
touched and passed it. There was
a moment of promise, rather than of
ecstasy, then of peace.</p>

<p>She opened her eyes. &#8220;Owin,&#8221;
she whispered. But she was alone.</p>

<p>She went out of the ferns and
mounted her horse, and rode rapidly
homeward. As she turned the corner
of Casa Norte she heard the telephone
bell ring violently. A
groom met her and lifted her from
the horse. She walked down the
garden toward the door. Her aunt
entered the office. Helena paused
outside of the window to listen to
the ridiculous one-sided conversation
of the telephone.</p>

<p>&#8220;Halloo!</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span>&#8220;Speak louder, please.</p>

<p>&#8220;A what?</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh&mdash;how dreadful!</p>

<p>&#8220;What? The trestle? Are you
sure? How awful! How high is
it?</p>

<p>&#8220;Three hundred feet! Great
heavens! Were any lives lost?</p>

<p>&#8220;Everybody? Oh, impossible&mdash;but
of course&mdash;three hundred feet.</p>

<p>&#8220;Only a few passengers&mdash;well
that is something.</p>

<p>&#8220;The cars are on fire, you say.
Oh, merciful heaven!</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I am glad. That is one
blessing, at least. Of course they
were killed instantly on those rocks.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who? What? My God! No!
No! Why, he was here only this
morning. It&#8217;s impossible! Impossible!</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Cartright staggered to her
feet, her face appearing before the
open window. Her jaw was fallen,
her skin the color of dough. She
saw Helena.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; she gasped. &#8220;What&mdash;what
do you think has happened?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span>&#8220;What?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The train went over the trestle
by Jo Bagley&#8217;s&mdash;three hundred feet&mdash;burnt
up. And Mr. Clive&mdash;isn&#8217;t
it awful that I should have spoken
to him not three hours ago?&mdash;was
on it. Jo Bagley says he spoke to
him when the train stopped. Oh,
Helena Belmont, how can you look
so indifferent!&#8221;</p>

<p>Helena turned and went back
into the forest.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8482;
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away--you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions

</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;

Gutenberg&#8482; License.

any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

provided that:
</div>

<div style='margin-left:0.7em;'>
    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

        &#8226; You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal

PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
